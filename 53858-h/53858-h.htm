i</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following pages contain
lectures read before the members of St. Margaret&rsquo;s
Institute, at Lowestoft, with additions introduced to render the
story somewhat more complete.</p>
<p>Lowestoft of the present day, with its harbour, its
magnificent fishing fleet, and its fine marine terraces, is the
product of the nineteenth century.&nbsp; But the Present is
linked with the Past by the retention of the old Town on the
Cliff as the nucleus of the greatly enlarged modern town.</p>
<p>The rise of Lowestoft was so much connected with the fortunes
of Yarmouth that it would be impossible to tell the story of old
Lowestoft without introducing a good deal that belongs to the
history of old Yarmouth.&nbsp; Indeed, were it not for the
records which have been preserved of the contests between the two
towns about the Herring Trade, the materials for a history of
Lowestoft would be almost nil.&nbsp; The history of Yarmouth is
only introduced into this sketch so far as it is incidental to
that of Lowestoft.&nbsp; But I feel that apologies are due to the
larger and more ancient town for the partial manner in which its
history is dealt with.</p>
<p>The materials from which these lectures have been compiled are
furnished by Domesday Book, the Lay Subsidy Rolls, the Parish
Register, and the ancient documents contained in Swinden&rsquo;s
History of Yarmouth, and Gillingwater&rsquo;s History of
Lowestoft.&nbsp; Other historical details of interest have been
taken from those valuable old works, and from Nall&rsquo;s
History of Yarmouth and Suckling&rsquo;s History of Suffolk.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Part i</span>.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Introductory</span>&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Geological</span>.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">You</span> will think that I am going
unnecessarily far back in commencing my sketch with a reference
to that very remote period</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When Britain first at Heaven&rsquo;s
command<br />
Arose from out the azure main.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But if a thousand years or so would take in the origin of both
Lowestoft and Yarmouth, questions have arisen affecting the
relations of these towns which involve a much more extended
retrospect.</p>
<p>It has long been a tenet of Lowestoft people that Lowestoft is
a more ancient town than Yarmouth.&nbsp; In some of the numerous
petitions presented to Parliament in connection with the disputes
between the two towns about the Herring Trade, her greater
antiquity was put forward by Lowestoft as giving her a prior
claim to the herrings which visit the seas off this coast.</p>
<p><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>There is
a story that the learned Potter, the translator of
&AElig;schylus, when vicar of the parish (about 1780) received a
letter from the Archbishop of Canterbury addressed to him at
&ldquo;Lowestoft near Yarmouth.&rdquo;&nbsp; The vicar was
indignant at what he regarded as a slight on his town, and when
replying to the Archbishop, added this postscript &ldquo;My Lord,
when you direct to me again be pleased to write simply
Lowestoft&mdash;Lowestoft does not want Yarmouth for a direction
post, for Lowestoft was ere Yarmouth rose out of the azure
main.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, the question whether the Waveney ever flowed out at
Lowestoft was a matter of warm discussion some 60 or 70 years
ago, when the project of making a connection between that river
and the sea, and providing Lowestoft with a harbour (an
undertaking since so successfully carried out) was first
mooted.&nbsp; The belief that the Waveney did once run out here,
was supposed to give much sanction to a project which would only
restore to the town an advantage which nature had originally
given her.</p>
<p>These questions have been touched upon by writers on the
antiquities of our neighbourhood, but not in a very satisfactory
way.&nbsp; The tradition that the Waveney, or a branch of it,
used to enter the sea at Lowestoft, has been reproduced by
several writers as part of a picture which represents Norwich and
Beccles, and other places on the borders of our marshlands, as
ports and fishing towns on the shore of a large inland sea or
estuary over which ships sailed freely, and to which herrings
innumerable used to pay their autumnal visit which they now
confine to the sea outside.&nbsp; That the sea at some time
flowed over at least a great part of this area is probably quite
true.&nbsp; No tradition would be required to satisfy the most
ordinary observer that such a condition of things might have once
existed, nor would anything more be needed to give rise to such a
tradition.&nbsp; The question is when did this condition of the
surface exist, and when did it cease to exist.</p>
<p><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>We will
take as our guide to the solution of this problem a very
interesting pamphlet by the late Mr. Edwards, the engineer
employed in cutting out the channel for our harbour in 1829,
entitled &ldquo;The River Waveney&mdash;did it ever reach the sea
via Lowestoft?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thus commences his account of the physical history of the
Waveney Valley&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;First and in order of date, what can be
gleaned from Geological evidence?&nbsp; It is universally
admitted that the last great change of the surface of the earth,
by whatever cause brought about, left the surface of the uplands
very much in the same form in which we now find them.&rdquo; p.
6.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Edwards refrains from expressing any view as to the causes
which brought about this last great change.&nbsp; He was probably
not familiar with the explanation with which recent geological
science has furnished us.&nbsp; If you refer to any of the more
recent treatises on the geology of Great Britain, you will find
somewhere in the later chapters an account of the subsidence and
elevation of these islands during what is called the Glacial
Period&mdash;movements due to what may be generally described as
the settlement of the earth&rsquo;s crust. <a
name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3"
class="citation">[3]</a></p>
<p>In no part of England is there more striking evidence of this
movement than in the coast district of Norfolk and Suffolk.&nbsp;
The old land surface which went down and was re-elevated nearly
to its former level, is well known in these parts as the Forest
Bed, which now forms the bottom of the sea at a short distance
from the shore from Cromer to Kessingland.&nbsp; It appears as
the lowest stratum of the cliff at Kessingland, and at other
places on our coast.&nbsp; It is also disclosed in inland pits
from which some of its most marvellous relics have been
extracted.&nbsp; That the surface of this bed was once above
water and covered with terrestrial vegetation, like that on which
we now have our being, is proved by the stumps of trees which
have been found fixed upright in it, as they were when alive and
growing.&nbsp; A specimen of these old tree stumps is to be seen
in the Norwich Museum.&nbsp; It is on this old land surface <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>and more or
less embedded in it, that the relics of an older world are
buried, which so frequently make their appearance in the trawl
nets of our fishermen,&mdash;the teeth and bones of Elephants,
the Rhinoceros, Hippopotamus, and other animals, which now belong
to the fauna of countries far away to the south.&nbsp; This old
land surface has been covered with some hundred or more feet of
sand, clay, and gravel deposited upon it during the process of
subsidence, and which after the re-elevation of the Island formed
the surface soil of a great part of Suffolk and Norfolk.</p>
<p>The process of subsidence and re-elevation was probably
extremely slow, producing an alteration of about two feet in a
hundred years.&nbsp; An elevatory movement of this kind has been
known to have taken place in recent times in the northern
regions, and is said to be still going on in Finland.</p>
<p>How many thousands of years ago this movement took place is a
matter for geologists to discuss, the important point that we
have to bear in mind is that from the time this movement ceased
all the alterations which have taken place are due to causes
still in operation and acting in the same manner now as then.</p>
<p>What was done by the sea in carving out the surface into hill
and valley during the process of elevation we know not, but Mr.
Edwards is probably right in holding that when the upward
movement ceased the contour of the surface, as regards highlands
and lowlands, hills and valleys, was very much what it is
now.</p>
<p>In considering the effect of the natural forces still in
operation during the many thousands of years during which they
have been at work, it is necessary to bear in mind that the level
of the sea has all along remained the same, except so far as it
is varied by the rise and fall of the tide, and by the
exceptional exaggerations of tidal movement caused by the
wind.</p>
<p>The operations of nature which have brought about the filling
up of the hollows in the glacial land have been (1) the flow of
water from wide drainage areas in Norfolk and Suffolk <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>carrying silt
into the lower parts and depositing it there,&mdash;(2) the
incessant action of the sea in building up a shore boundary
against itself, and blocking up the gaps in the glacial highlands
through which its waters would flow inland.&nbsp; This action of
the sea on our eastern coast is due to the inexhaustible supply
of sand and shingle which is being constantly pushed along the
shore southwards by the tidal wave.&nbsp; How persistent is the
action of the sea in blocking up every outlet, whether river or
harbour mouth, which man would wish kept open, has been a matter
of costly experience to Yarmouth for some 800 years, as it has
been to the Great Eastern Railway Company during the short time
that they have undertaken the task of keeping open the mouth of
Lowestoft Harbour.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Waveney</span>.</h4>
<p>The ground formed by the deposit of alluvial soil from the
interior, and the drifting inwards of sand and shingle from the
sea is in some places not easily distinguishable from the old
glacial ground on which it has been imposed.&nbsp; As regards
land well above high water mark, no doubt can arise however
similar the sand of which it is composed may be to the sand on
our shores.&nbsp; Such deposits must have been formed before the
land had risen to its present level.&nbsp; But as regards
deposits which are beneath or nearly on a level with high water
mark, on the edge of what is now water or marsh-land, the
difference in their origin may be difficult to ascertain and
easily overlooked.&nbsp; The sand in our cliffs and on the shore
is indeed the same:&mdash;the sea using the material which it has
robbed from some projecting cliff, to fill up some bay or make an
addition to the land to the southward.&nbsp; That the supposed
ancient outlet between Lake Lothing and the sea was blocked up by
sand and shingle in the same way as other outlets along the
coast, was a very reasonable supposition, until the cutting of
the channel for the new harbour disclosed a ridge of old glacial
soil between the head of the lake and the sea, extending across
the dip between Lowestoft and Kirkley, which <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>proved that no
deep river had ever flowed out there.&nbsp; This ridge was
excavated to a depth of 30 feet below high water mark.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It consisted&rdquo; Mr. Edwards tells us &ldquo;not of
horizontal stratified sand and shingle, as was found on the
beach, but of precisely such strata of sand, as that of the
rising ground on either side of the valley, the like of which may
now be seen on Pope&rsquo;s Farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although this ridge was too high to admit of a deep river
running into the sea from Lake Lothing, it was not so high as to
prevent a shallow overflow from the lake on to the beach,
producing a small channel, between the lake and the sea.&nbsp;
Evidence of the existence of such a channel in remote times has
been preserved by its having been adopted as a boundary between
the parishes of Lowestoft and Kirkley.&nbsp; It appears from an
old enclosure map, that the boundary at this part had varied, as
the channel shifted from north to south, until it reached the
rising ground of Kirkley Cliff, where it formed the line of the
existing boundary.</p>
<p>Tradition assigns to this part the name of Kirkley
&ldquo;Haven;&rdquo; and the fact that the Roads along the coast
from Pakefield to Yarmouth had in very remote times acquired the
name of &ldquo;Kirklee Road&rdquo; is proof that Kirkley must
have been known to sailors more than the other villages on the
cliffs.&nbsp; It is probable that the low coast, and its
proximity to the Roads, to which ships resorted for anchorage in
remote times as in recent years, led to it being used by sailors
as a convenient place for communication with the shore; which
would be quite sufficient to give it the name of &ldquo;Kirkley
Haven,&rdquo; whether any use was or was not made of the little
channel in question as a waterway for boats or other light
craft.</p>
<p>After the fens had been reclaimed, and converted into pasture
lands, it became necessary to protect them from the inundation of
the extraordinary high tides which occurred occasionally in
ancient times, as now, under the influence of a prolonged spell
of north west wind.&nbsp; An embankment or
&ldquo;fortification&rdquo; was erected along this ridge with the
object of preventing any <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>irruption of the sea though Lake
Lothing into the interior.&nbsp; We have a full account of the
measures taken in 1660 for the reparation of a former embankment
in the same place.&nbsp; In Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s time Lake
Lothing was purely a freshwater lake, and it was called
&ldquo;The Freshwater&rdquo; by Lowestoft people.&nbsp; The
ordinary outlet for the water was not towards the sea, but
through Oulton &ldquo;Fen&rdquo; into the Waveney.&nbsp; Camden
writing at this time describes Lake Lothing as&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That long and spacious Lake Lothing, which
beginning at the seaside empties itself into the river
Yare.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A similar ridge of glacial deposit extending between Oulton
Broad and Lake Lothing, formed the foundation of the ancient and
existing roadway which connects Lothingland with the
mainland.&nbsp; This ridge placed another effectual bar to the
outflow of the waters of the Waveney Valley in this direction,
though here again there seems always to have been a small shallow
dip, the old &ldquo;Mud-ford,&rdquo; through which the water on
either side was connected.&nbsp; No such ridges blocked the wide
mouth of the estuary at Yarmouth, which was open for the flow of
water out and in until the sea had blocked it up with an
accumulation of sand and shingle to the depth&mdash;Mr. Edwards
says&mdash;of some hundred feet.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">the silting up of the
estuary</span>.</h4>
<p>The natural process by which the valley of the Waveney became
gradually filled up with silt, and covered with aquatic
vegetation is carefully explained by Mr. Edwards.&nbsp; How many
thousands of years the process was going on before nature had
converted the wide and apparently deep estuary into an expanse of
fen and bog, with the Waveney, the Yare, and the Bure, flowing
through it in well defined channels we know not; but Mr. Edwards
mentions an interesting fact showing that nature&rsquo;s process
of substituting land for water is still in progress.&nbsp; We
know that some hundreds of years ago man took advantage of the
work already done by nature, and converted these fens and
morasses into dry marshlands by raising banks <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>along the river
sides to keep out the flood and tidal waters.&nbsp; Between these
banks and the river there are margins several yards in breadth
called &ldquo;rands&rdquo; or &ldquo;ronds.&rdquo;&nbsp; These
rands have been left open to the overflow of the river, and they
are found to be raised from one to two feet above the level of
the inclosed lands on the other side of the banks.&nbsp; Another
process by which nature has been and is still slowly substituting
land for water is the advance of the reedy margins of the broads
and the gradual diminution of the water area.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Burgh Castle</span>.</h4>
<p>The first evidence we have of the stage which the silting up
process had reached during the time of man&rsquo;s occupation of
these parts are the records and vestiges of the presence of the
Romans on the banks of the Yare and the Waveney during the first
four centuries of the present era.</p>
<p>In his account of Burgh Castle Mr. Suckling gives us a map
shewing the different positions occupied by the Romans in these
parts in connection with their system of coast defences against
the Saxons, or other tribes on the opposite shores of the North
Sea, whose piratical visitations were as much a cause of fear to
the British inhabitants of our island as they were several
hundred years later to its &ldquo;Saxon&rdquo; inhabitants
themselves.</p>
<p>According to this map we have the strong fortress of Burgh
Castle placed in the northern extremity of Lothingland, in such a
position as to command a view of the entrance of the Yare and the
Waveney from the estuary, the diminished area of which is still
represented by Breydon water.&nbsp; A short way up the Yare we
find another Roman Station at Reedham where the river approaches
close to the glacial highlands, and where an invading force
sailing up this river would find a convenient landing place at
the river side, not separated from the river channel by a wide
space of impassable morass, or shallows only navigable at high
water.&nbsp; A few miles up the Waveney we have another Roman
Station at Burgh St. Peter (or Wheatacre Burgh) at the extremity
of a tongue of glacial highland, which <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>is again closely approached by the
present channel of the river.&nbsp; The extraordinary position of
the church, at the lowest and extreme edge of a parish which
contains a large area of high ground proves that this spot had
some mysterious importance in remote times, and the existence of
Roman bricks in its walls, which may have been used in several
successive buildings since they were made, points to the
existence of some Roman fortress nearby to which they originally
belonged; while the remains of human skeletons which have been
found near the bank of the river buried in a promiscuous manner,
as if the result of a battle on the river&rsquo;s edge, add
support to the view that Burgh Staithe, being a convenient
landing place for the invader, was a place of considerable
importance in ancient times.</p>
<p>If the low marshland through which the Yare and the Waveney
now wind their way to the sea was at the time when the Romans
established their system of fortifications, a wilderness of bog
and fen, impassable either by ship or on foot, we can understand
the importance of these spots on the river-sides where the enemy
could get from their boats on to the highlands of Norfolk and
Suffolk.&nbsp; The conflict of opinion among antiquarians as to
the true site of the Roman Garianonum has made the conditions of
the area immediately beneath Burgh Castle in the Roman period, a
familiar subject of discussion.&nbsp; Whether Burgh Castle or
Caister was the Roman Garianonum, the disputants took it for
granted that it was some place near the entrance of the river
from which it took its name; but they appear to have overlooked
the point that if there were any river channel near either Burgh
or Caister which could be attributed to the Yare, the estuarine
condition of the interior must have already passed away.&nbsp;
When this inland area was an arm of the sea, as it has been so
often described, the rivers which meet at Yarmouth must have lost
their channels and their names several miles further west.&nbsp;
The Yare would have terminated at Norwich or Reedham, the Waveney
at Beccles, and the Bure somewhere about Wroxham.&nbsp; The Yare
could <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>have
had no claim to give its name to any place near the present
coast, either Burgh or Caister.&nbsp; The Orwell is still an arm
of the sea and it is not called after either the Gipping or the
Stour.&nbsp; The Romans probably named their fortress at Burgh
from the Yare, rather than the Waveney because the river Yare was
the common waterway from the Roman camp at Caister on the Taes to
the sea.</p>
<p>The massive fortress of Burgh Castle could be safely held by a
small force for a long time against any enemy who might succeed
in effecting a landing on Lothingland itself, and if cavalry were
kept there, as we are told they were, mounted messengers could be
sent off as soon as a hostile fleet appeared, who would be able
to carry the intelligence to head quarters at Caister, via Oulton
and Beccles or Bungay, before the enemy could get very far up
either river.</p>
<p>The peculiar arrangement of the walls of Burgh Castle, which
while they presented an impregnable defence on the North, East
and South sides, left the west side with an easy slope down to
the level of the river, unprotected, can only be explained by
supposing with Camden and Spelman that the area between the river
and the cliff, which is now marsh, was then an impassable morass,
which offered an insuperable obstacle to the approach of a
hostile force either by ship or on foot. <a
name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10"
class="citation">[10]</a></p>
<p>The existence of Burgh Castle at the northern extremity of
Lothingland is also strong evidence that the detached portion of
the mainland was no more an island then than it is now.&nbsp;
Such a fortress would be absurdly out of place to protect the
country from an invader, if there was another open water-way at
Lowestoft through which he could enter.</p>
<p>From these and the other considerations to which I have <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>called your
attention we may feel certain that the estuarine condition of the
interior had ceased to exist as long ago as the Roman period, and
that our marshland area was already in a condition of fen and
bog, through which the Yare, and the Waveney, and the Bure flowed
in their present channels to their joint outfall between Burgh
and Caister, some thousand years before any historic Norwich or
Beccles existed.&nbsp; The hill on which Lowestoft was destined
to rise in after ages, was probably often visited by the Roman
soldiers as they passed to and fro between their fortress at
Burgh and their camp in the interior, but no relics have as yet
been discovered bearing testimony to either Roman or British
occupation of the site of our town, though Roman coins have been
found at Kirkley, and Carlton and other places in our
neighbourhood.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Part</span> II.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Domesday Book</span>.</h3>
<p>The most ancient record in which we find any mention of
Lowestoft is Domesday Book.&nbsp; As this is the case with nearly
every other town and parish in England, Lowestoft is not behind
other places in evidence of antiquity.</p>
<p>But Lowestoft not only appears in Domesday as a parish and a
village, but it appears as a Royal manor&mdash;or at least as one
of the numerous estates or demesnes held by William the
Conqueror, as his private property&mdash;as the successor of
Edward the Confessor and Canute.&nbsp; On the strength of this
arch&aelig;ological distinction, the town in the time of
Elizabeth and Charles I., claimed the privileges of lands in
&lsquo;ancient demesne.&rsquo;&nbsp; These privileges were that
the town was excused from contributing to the expenses of the
members of Parliament for the county, and its inhabitants were
not to be called upon to go to Beccles or Bury as jurymen, but
only to their own Manor Courts <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>at Corton.&nbsp; The exercise of
these privileges has, I understand, been abandoned for some time,
and we have condescended to take part in the judicial and
political system of the country like other places.&nbsp; What
this ancient &ldquo;demesne of the Crown&rdquo; was we shall see
presently.&nbsp; You have all, I doubt not, heard of Domesday
Book, but you will be able to appreciate better the value and
meaning of the information it gives us if I remind you shortly of
its history.</p>
<p>In 1066 William won the Battle of Hastings, and on the
strength of this victory claimed England as its conqueror, and
not merely as the chosen successor of Edward.&nbsp; As conqueror
of the country the whole of England was at his disposal, and he
gave the lands of the Saxon (or according to Mr. Freeman and Mr.
Green, &lsquo;English&rsquo;) proprietors to his French
followers.&nbsp; They made full use of the King&rsquo;s grant,
and in a few years almost every Saxon landlord had disappeared,
or if any remained, they remained as tenants of small portions of
their estates to the ownership of which a Norman landlord
had&mdash;as they called it&mdash;&ldquo;succeeded.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We are told of one Norman Knight, who having fought for William
at Hastings, refused to take any share in this wholesale
robbery.&nbsp; He had done his duty as a vassal in fighting for
William, and he preferred to return to Normandy and be contented
with his own property there; not so though the rest.</p>
<p>You must understand that the great change brought about by the
conquest was at first only a change of landlords, and involved no
alteration in the laws and customs by which property was
held.&nbsp; The parishes, the manors, the farms, the occupying
tenants, and the labourers on the estates were not
disturbed.&nbsp; Even the live and dead stock on the farms were
all claimed by the new owners, and to a large extent actually got
possession of by them.</p>
<p>After this process of ousting the Saxon landlords had been
going on for some years&mdash;not, as you may suppose without a
good deal of fighting and cruelty&mdash;the country was becoming
<a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>settled,
and the King thought it time to learn in whose possession its
lands were, and what their estates were worth.&nbsp; So he
appointed a commission of enquiry, to go through the whole
country and report to him the names of all the possessors of
estates, and what amount of land producing corn their estates
contained, and what live and dead stock, including the tenants
belonging to each estate, were on the land, and what each manor
and estate was valued at.&nbsp; The results of this enquiry,
which took some six years to complete, were put together by
clerks, and written out in as concise a manner as possible on
parchment&mdash;and so Domesday Book was formed.</p>
<p>As the commissioners had to ascertain so far as they could,
what differences had taken place in the ownership and occupation
of land, and in its condition and value, since the Conquest,
Domesday Book, although made some 20 years after England was
under the Normans, gives us a picture of the country as it was in
later Saxon times, and it is from this book that most of our
knowledge of the condition of England in the Saxon period is
derived.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Parishes of Lothingland</span>.</h4>
<p>The map <a name="citation13"></a><a href="#footnote13"
class="citation">[13]</a> represents the Hundred of Mutford and
Lothingland (then called the two half hundreds of Mutford and
Lothingland) as it is now divided into parishes.&nbsp; Nearly all
these parishes are mentioned in Domesday under their present
names (though of course not spelt precisely in the same
way).&nbsp; Many, if not all, of them had probably existed under
the same name, and with much the same boundaries some 300 years
before, under the Saxon and Danish kings of East Anglia.&nbsp;
They appear in Domesday as the known areas in which the estates
reported upon were situated, but the parishes themselves were not
the subject of the survey, nor does the term &ldquo;parish&rdquo;
appear either in English or Latin.&nbsp; The word
&ldquo;Villa&rdquo; is frequently used to denote these areas,
just as <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>&ldquo;Town&rdquo; was commonly used as an equivalent
for &ldquo;parish&rdquo; in much later times.&nbsp; The book is
written in a sort of Latinised English, but the names of places
retain the vernacular form.&nbsp; As they are spelt very
differently in different entries, Domesday is no authority for
the correct spelling of any of our parish names.&nbsp; But the
form they bear in Domesday throws much light on their
etymological origin.&nbsp; To what extent the estates mentioned
in Domesday were contained in the parishes to which they are
allocated is doubtful.&nbsp; In a few cases the several manors
returned as being situated in a particular parish would appear to
require a larger area than the parish now contains, but in nearly
all cases the amount of land reported upon as being under tillage
in a parish is very much less than the land now under
cultivation.</p>
<p>In his history of the Norman Conquest Mr. Freeman says of
Domesday:&mdash;&ldquo;Domesday teaches better than any other
witness of those times can teach us, that the England of the 11th
century and the England of the 19th are one and the same
thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; We will now see what it teaches us about
Lowestoft.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Lowestoft in Domesday Book</span>.</h4>
<p>In the return of the King&rsquo;s estates in the Half-hundred
of Lothingland (Ludingland as it was written) we have a rather
long account of the King&rsquo;s Manor of Gorleston, which
appears to have been the headquarters from which the royal
estates in Lothingland were administered for several hundred
years.&nbsp; It states that &ldquo;Gurth (Earl Gurth, the brother
of Harold, killed at the battle of Hastings) held Gorleston in
King Edward&rsquo;s time, and after giving the details of his
property in Gorleston,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There are 24 fishermen belonging to this
manor at Gernemutha (Yarmouth) and a beruita (or subordinate
manor) in Lothu Wistoft (Lowestoft). <a name="citation14"></a><a
href="#footnote14" class="citation">[14]</a>&nbsp; It contains
four carucates.&nbsp; In King Edward&rsquo;s time there were five
villani (bond tenants of the upper class)&mdash;now only
three.&nbsp; Both then and now there are ten cottage
tenants.&nbsp; Then there were five servi (slaves), now only
three.&nbsp; Then and now there are two ploughs employed on the
demesne (the Kings own land).&nbsp; In Edward&rsquo;s time the
tenants employed five ploughs on their land, now only
three.&nbsp; There is woodland for eight pigs, and five acres of
pasture.&nbsp; In King Edward&rsquo;s time there were thirteen
geese, now only eight.&nbsp; There were then and now ten pigs,
and 150 sheep.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>We have
here the account of a small estate, comprising some 400 or 500
acres of cultivated land, of which part was in demesne, and
cultivated for the King, and the rest was comprised in one or two
large open fields, which were divided into allotments, and
cultivated by the tenants for themselves, all of whom could have
their little homesteads, and their shares in the plough-oxen, and
other live stock kept on the land.</p>
<p>This estate had not passed from the hands of the Saxon Earl
Gurth to those of William without disturbance.&nbsp; Three of the
villani and two slaves had disappeared.&nbsp; They had, perhaps,
been in Earl Gurth&rsquo;s army, and had fallen with him at
Hastings. Several acres of land had fallen out of cultivation,
and though the pigs and sheep had remained at the same number,
the geese were reduced from thirteen to eight.</p>
<p>Besides the King&rsquo;s berwick there was a small manor in
the parish called Aketorp, belonging to a freeman named Aylmar, a
priest, probably the priest of the parish.&nbsp; His name tells
us that he was an Englishman, and not one of the
Conqueror&rsquo;s Frenchmen.&nbsp; His little property consisted
of 80 acres, on which there were three cottage tenants.&nbsp; One
plough was used on the demesne.&nbsp; There were seven other
tenants who had land requiring half a plough.&nbsp; (They must
have had other means of supporting themselves.)&nbsp; There was
wood for five pigs, and one acre of pasture.</p>
<p>Priest Aylmar had not been disturbed by the Conquest, and his
little property was in the same condition in 1085 as it was in
1066.&nbsp; The rest of the land in the parish would be common or
waste land, over which the cattle, sheep, and pigs of the lords
and their tenants could roam and feed.</p>
<p>So far as Domesday furnishes us with express authority, the
population of the parish in Edward&rsquo;s time consisted of 31
different families.&nbsp; But I think that there may have been a
few others&mdash;poor freemen&mdash;not belonging to these
estates, and <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>not coming within the scope of the survey, who gained a
living partly by assisting the tenants in their agricultural
work, and partly as fishermen, having their boats on the shore or
at Kirkley Haven, which was quite alive at this time.&nbsp; These
men would be the earliest representatives of the free population
of the parish which was destined in after times, when trade had
sprung up, to form the main population of the town of
Lowestoft.</p>
<p>The church is not mentioned, but, as there was a resident
priest, there can be no reason to doubt that there was a parish
church&mdash;probably a small wooden building on the site of the
present church.&nbsp; Churches were more numerous in Suffolk and
Norfolk in Saxon times than in any other part of England.&nbsp;
Several churches are mentioned in other parishes near, apparently
because they had some substantial amount of glebe land belonging
to them.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Neighbouring Parishes</span>.</h4>
<p>We shall understand somewhat better the picture which Domesday
gives us of Lowestoft if we take a glance at the accounts which
it gives of some other parishes in the immediate
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The parishes in Lothingland, in which the greatest number of
estates are returned are Somerleyton, Lound, and Belton.&nbsp; I
believe that these parishes contain the best agricultural land in
the district.&nbsp; The church in Somerleyton is mentioned as
having 20 acres of glebe belonging to it, but the parish
priest&mdash;or parson as he was afterwards called&mdash;appears
to have possessed a small manor of 40 acres in addition.</p>
<p>Gunton is not mentioned in Domesday.&nbsp; Corton appears as
containing an estate belonging to the Crown, of which no details
are given, except that it was valued at 20s.</p>
<p>The lost Newton is mentioned as a small estate of 30 acres,
owned by a freeman, and valued at 3s.&nbsp; Newton existed for
several hundred years as a small hamlet to the north of Corton,
but has been long since carried away by <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>the sea,
except parts of one or two fields still left on the top of the
cliff.</p>
<p>In the Half-Hundred of Mutford, the parishes of Kessingland,
Carlton, and Mutford, appear as containing large villages, and
several estates which had passed from Saxon Thanes to Norman
Barons.</p>
<p>In Mutford there were two churches, with lands belonging to
them in Rushmere, Kirkley, Pakefield, and Gisleham.&nbsp; In the
account of Pakefield we hear that Earl Gurth possessed one
mediety of the living, which was divided between two Rectors up
to the 17th century.&nbsp; It is probable that the prototype of
the present double church was in existence then.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Herring Rents</span>.</h4>
<p>Domesday contains evidence of much interest in connection with
the history of our herring fishery, in the returns of herring
rents from farms in this neighbourhood.</p>
<p>One of the largest Norman landowners in these parts was Hugo
de Montfort.&nbsp; He appears to have been connected with the sea
when in Normandy, for it is said that he supplied William with 60
ships to carry his men over to England.&nbsp; Whether Hugo was
very fond of herrings, or because he wished to encourage the
herring fishery we know not, but it appears that when he had
turned out the English landowner Burchard, and taken possession
of his farms, he not only raised the money rents, but he required
many of the tenants to supply him with herrings in addition.</p>
<p>In Kessingland he became the landlord of a small estate held
by four freeman, which had been valued at 10s., but from which
Hugo demanded a rent of 22,000 herrings. <a
name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17"
class="citation">[17]</a></p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>In
Rushmere he had a farm which paid him as rent 700 herrings.</p>
<p>In Gisleham he had two small farms, from one of which he got
2s. 6d. and 200 herrings, and from the other 5s. and 300
herrings.</p>
<p>In Carlton he had one farm from which he got 3s. as rent and
400 herrings, and from another 5s. and 300 herrings.</p>
<p>In Kirkley he had a farm from which he got 3s. and 200
herrings.</p>
<p>He also got herring rents from farms in Worlingham, Weston,
Wangford, and some other places which I cannot identify.</p>
<p>This Norman Baron doubtless desired to encourage the herring
fishery, and so imposed these herring rents on his tenants who
occupied farms near the coast, where herrings could easily be
obtained.&nbsp; Had he possessed any land in Lowestoft I have no
doubt that we should read in Domesday of herring rents being paid
from this parish.&nbsp; The large number demanded from the four
freemen in Kessingland is good evidence, I think, of the herring
fishery being carried on there at this time to a considerable
extent.&nbsp; Kessingland was a large village at this time, with
a haven in the little river which now separates it from
Benacre.&nbsp; Although Domesday makes no mention of any
fishermen, or fishing trade, in the returns for these parishes,
the herring rents are conclusive evidence that herrings were
caught off this coast it large quantities at this time.&nbsp;
Sea-fishing was probably carried on also by the inhabitants of
Pakefield and Kirkley at this time.</p>
<p>Kirkley does not appear to have ever been more than a small
village, although it gave its name to the Roads off this
coast.</p>
<p>Carlton was a large and populous village at this time, and
appears to have been so from early Saxon times.&nbsp; It is
supposed that the name is taken from the large number of <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>&ldquo;Ceorls,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Karls,&rdquo;&mdash;as
we should now say &ldquo;Working-class people&rdquo;&mdash;who
lived there.&nbsp; Lake Lothing would furnish them with an easy
passage to and from the sea, and when landed at Carlton the fish
would be on the old Roman road leading to Beccles, Norwich, and
Bury.&nbsp; Doubtless the herrings which Hugh de Montfort got
from his farms in this parish were caught by fishermen living
there.&nbsp; Fishing in small boats, by what we should now call
&ldquo;longshore-men,&rdquo; had probably been carried on from
these sea-side villages for hundreds of years before
Domesday.</p>
<p>But at this time the herring fishery had become established at
Yarmouth, and the celebrated Free Fair was already held there
during the autumn season.&nbsp; In the account of Gorleston we
have noticed that 24 men belonging to that manor were said to be
fishermen living away at Yarmouth.&nbsp; As there were as many as
70 burgesses in Yarmouth in the time of King Edward, and the town
paid a large rent to the king, we may be quite safe in regarding
Yarmouth as doing a large business in the herring trade even in
late Saxon times.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Live Stock on the Farms</span>.</h4>
<p>Although the returns from the different estates in our
neighbourhood are compiled on the same system in Domesday Book,
they vary very much in respect of the details given, particularly
in respect of the live stock on the manors and farms
reported.&nbsp; This is no more than what we should expect.</p>
<p>The returns of the live stock which they possessed would give
the Conqueror very useful information as to the amount of
taxation his subjects could bear, and he could hardly expect to
get many trust-worthy returns on this head.&nbsp; In the accounts
of many of the manors they are omitted entirely.&nbsp; In the
accounts of others the return of live stock is very small in
proportion to the size of the estate.&nbsp; It is probable that
the stock owned by the tenants is omitted altogether.&nbsp; Pigs
must have been the animals on which the lower class of tenants <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>principally
relied for their meat, but the pigs in most of the returns are
very few, only eight on the King&rsquo;s estate in Lowestoft.</p>
<p>In the account of a large manor at Mutford&mdash;to which 40
tenants belonged&mdash;the return of live stock mentions 7 geese,
30 pigs, 30 goats, and two hives of bees.</p>
<p>Some of the estates appear to have been very well
stocked.&nbsp; On the farm of 40 acres belonging to the parish
priest of Somerleyton, there was 1 horse, 4 cows, 5 pigs, and 33
sheep&mdash;besides the plough cattle.&nbsp; On the King&rsquo;s
farm in Lound, which was not half the size of his Lowestoft
estate, there were 50 pigs.</p>
<p>On a farm of 40 acres in Belton there was 1 horse, 2 geese, 7
pigs, 30 sheep, and 3 goats.</p>
<p>In addition to these animals the owners of these estates had
draught oxen for ploughing.</p>
<p>It would appear that the produce of the arable land was nearly
all required for feeding its human occupants, and that the geese
and the pigs and other animals would be limited to such numbers
as could find food for themselves in the woods and wild land
which was common to the lords and tenants of each manor.</p>
<p>These returns of live stock, although they would have been
very valuable to the Conqueror and ourselves, if they were
complete and trustworthy, are so manifestly defective and
irregularly made in most cases, that they furnish very
unsatisfactory materials for forming an idea of the general
condition of the peasantry.&nbsp; But as we know that all the
tenants of a manor&mdash;even the lowest class of
bondmen&mdash;occupied some land for the maintenance of
themselves and their families, with rights of pasturage on the
common lands, probably most had some cattle and pigs of their
own, and were well provided with the necessaries of life.</p>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>The
country must have been in a stationary condition for hundreds of
years in the Saxon period owing to the entire absence of trade,
and the almost entire absence of money.&nbsp; The silver penny
was the only coin in circulation, and indeed for some two
centuries after.</p>
<p>With little or no opportunities for selling the produce of
their estates, the landowners had little reason to improve them,
nor could they increase their land under tillage without
interfering with the rights of their tenants on the waste
land.&nbsp; The system of serfdom, moreover, whilst it secured a
living to a large number of people, bound them and their children
to the estates on which they held their land, and must have
tended to deprive a large part of the population of the country
of any stimulus to enterprise or self improvement.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Serfdom</span>.</h4>
<p>It appears from Mr. Turner&rsquo;s computation of the
different classes forming the population of Suffolk, as shown in
Domesday, that some 10,000 out of the 22,000 were in the
condition of serfs, bound to some manor, either as small tenant
farmers paying rent as well as services for their land, or as
cottage tenants working on the demesne, or as mere slaves or
thralls, the absolute property of the lords. <a
name="citation21"></a><a href="#footnote21"
class="citation">[21]</a>&nbsp; I will not take you further into
this obscure and complicated question than to say that the
bondage of the greater part of the Anglo-Saxon peasantry implied
little more than that they were bound to remain on the estate to
perform the services for which they held their land.&nbsp; These
services were fixed as strictly as a money rent would be, and
left them plenty of time for working on their own land, while the
law provided various means by which they could obtain freedom for
themselves and their children.&nbsp; The Church&mdash;at all
events the parish clergy&mdash;always used their influence to
obtain the freedom of the lowest and most servile class.&nbsp; We
read of a case where an hereditary serf was holding <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>the high
position of bailiff of a large manor.&nbsp; Turner
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is mentioned in the laws as an incentive
to proper actions that through God&rsquo;s gift a servile thrall
may become a thane, and a c&oelig;orl an Earl, just as a singer
may become a priest and a writer a bishop.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the
time of Ethelstane it is expressly declared that &ldquo;if a
c&oelig;orl have a full proprietorship of five hides of land, a
church, and a kitchen, a bell house and a burghate seat, and an
appropriate office in the King&rsquo;s hall, he shall thenceforth
be a thane by right&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The opportunities, however, which the condition of society in
Saxon times offered for a serf to rise from the lowest to the
highest ranks must have been very few.&nbsp; In these days trade
and the professions furnish such a ladder, but in Saxon times
there was no profession but the church, whose members sometimes
found remunerative employment as clerks, or by devoting
themselves to religious duties rose to the highest offices.&nbsp;
The only trades in Saxon times were those of the handicraftsmen,
and, except in London and a few other towns, these would be
confined to the blacksmith and a few such craftsmen as were
indispensable to the smallest agricultural community.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Craftsmen</span>.</h4>
<p>Among the few literary productions of the Anglo Saxons which
have been preserved, we find descriptions of the more common
trades given in the form of dialogues.&nbsp; I take the following
from Mr. Turner&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; The shoemaker (sceowerhta)
thus describes his trade:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My craft is very necessary to you.&nbsp; I
buy hides and skins and prepare them by art, and make of them
shoes of various kinds, and none of you can winter without my
craft.&nbsp; I make ankle leathers, shoes, and leather hose;
bridle thongs, trappings, neck pieces, and halters; bottles,
flasks, boiling vessels, wallets and pouches.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the Saxon shoemaker was a much more accomplished man than
the shoemaker of the present day, for he combined the arts of the
tanner, the currier, and the harness maker with that of
shoemaking.&nbsp; The smith says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whence the share of the ploughman or the
goad? but from my art.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whence to the fisherman his angle? or to the shoe maker
his awl? or to the sempstress her needle but from my
art?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Hereford there are six smiths mentioned in Domesday.</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>They
paid a penny a year rent for their forges, and had to make up 120
pieces of iron for the king from the metal supplied them.&nbsp;
He must have been a very skilful blacksmith who could turn out
such different ironwork as ploughshares and needles and
fishhooks.&nbsp; A very important tradesman was the miller.&nbsp;
Mills were a much valued property, and are always mentioned in
the Domesday returns.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Merchant</span>.</h4>
<p>What foreign trade was in Saxon time appears from the account
which the merchant gives of his business&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I say that I am useful to the king, and to
ealdermen, and to the rich, and to the people.&nbsp; I ascend my
ship with my merchandise, and sail over the sealike places, and
sell my things, and buy dear things which are not produced in
this land, and I bring them to you here with the great danger of
the sea, and sometimes I suffer shipwreck, with the loss of all
my things, scarcely escaping myself.&nbsp; What do you bring to
us?&mdash;Skins, silks, costly gums and gold, various garments,
pigment, wine, oil, ivory, orichalcus, copper, tin, silver,
glass, and such like.&nbsp; Will you sell your things here as you
brought them there?&mdash;I will not, because what would my
labour benefit me?&nbsp; I will sell them here dearer than I
bought them there that I may have some profit to feed me and my
wife and children.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you see the Saxon merchant was an enterprising skipper, who
owned his ship, and having filled it with a cargo of English
produce, took it over to some foreign port and exchanged it for a
cargo of foreign goods, of all sorts and kinds, which he brought
back and sold at a high price in England.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Fisherman</span>.</h4>
<p>We have a sketch of a fisherman of the Saxon period, drawn by
no less a personage than Alfric, Archbishop of Canterbury, who
was living in the 11th century and was the wisest man of his
time, according to the Saxon chronicle.&nbsp; He wrote some
colloquies for his pupils to turn into Latin.&nbsp; One of them
treats of the fisherman:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What gettest thou by thy art?&mdash;Big
loaves, clothing, and money.&nbsp; How do you take fish?&mdash;I
ascend my ship, and cast my net into the river; I also take a
hook, a bait, and a rod.&nbsp; Suppose the fishes are
unclean?&mdash;I throw the unclean out, and take the clean for
food.&nbsp; Where do you sell your fish?&mdash;In the city.&nbsp;
Who buys them?&mdash;The citizens; I cannot take so many as I can
sell.&nbsp; What fishes do you take?&mdash;Eels, haddocks,
minnows, eel-pouts, <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>skate, and lampreys, and whatever swims in the
river.&nbsp; (The Archbishop rather mixed his fresh-water and
saltwater fish).&nbsp; Why do you not fish in the
sea?&mdash;Sometimes I do, but rarely because a great ship is
necessary there.&nbsp; What do you take in the
sea?&mdash;Herrings, salmon, porpoises, sturgeons, oysters,
crabs, muscles, winkles, cockles, flounder, plaices, lobsters,
and such like.&nbsp; Can you take a whale?&mdash;No, it is
dangerous to take a whale; it is safer for me to go to the river
with my ship than to go with many ships to hunt whales.&nbsp;
Why?&mdash;Because it is more pleasant to me to take fish which I
can kill with one blow.&nbsp; Yet many take whales without
danger, and then they get a great price, but I dare not for the
fearfulness of my mind.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These whale catchers were Norwegians and Danes, who, when they
were not raiding in England, employed themselves in whale fishing
off the Norwegian Coast.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Intellectual Condition of our
Ancestors</span>.</h4>
<p>But these Anglo-Danes of East Anglia were our ancestors.&nbsp;
They lived in the same villages, and tilled the same land as the
peasantry of the present day, and many of our country parishes
must have been in Saxon times very much what they are now, in
which the squire and the parson fill the places of the thane and
the parish priest and a few farmers holding land under the
squire, and agricultural labourers, enough and no more, than are
required to cultivate the land, with perhaps a village blacksmith
and shoemaker, complete the roll of the resident
population.&nbsp; The intellectual condition of our ancestors
must have been very low.&nbsp; Mr. Turner describes it as the
&ldquo;twilight of mind,&rdquo; and he says there is a great
similarity in their poetry to that of the natives of New
Zealand.&nbsp; Even the thanes and magnates of the land were,
with a very few exceptions, entirely uneducated, and if they had
learnt to read there would have been few books from which they
could have got any knowledge.&nbsp; King Alfred was one of the
few who could read in his time.&nbsp; With the upper classes in
such a barbarous condition no wonder we are told that gross
excess in eating and drinking was their characteristic
failing.&nbsp; Even the great and good Alfred is said to have
destroyed his constitution by having to take part in banqueting
for several days and nights in celebration of his wedding.&nbsp;
The prevalence of this low vice may be to a great extent <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>attributed to
the want of any means by which the produce of their farms could
be made a better use of.&nbsp; It was not until trade sprung up
that they could sell their surplus produce and spend the proceeds
in the purchase of things which would lead to a higher and more
civilised standard of living.&nbsp; But during the whole of the
Saxon period the monotonous routine of their agricultural
occupations was only varied by war, which was frequent enough;
and as war in those days was always accompanied by devastation
and slaughter, the slow progress of our Saxon fore-fathers in
wealth and civilisation is easily accounted for, and we can well
understand how it was that this fertile country was only
partially cultivated when the Normans came over, and how it was
that the Conqueror found his property in
&ldquo;Lothuwistoft&rdquo; in such a backward state.</p>
<p>Such was Lowestoft in its infancy&mdash;a small agricultural
village of less importance than Carlton or Mutford or
Kessingland.&nbsp; We shall now lose sight of her for some 300
years.&nbsp; When she again appears in the records of the past
she will appear as a town of some importance to the country, and
as a rival of Yarmouth in the herring trade.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Etymology of</span> &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Lowestoft</span>.&rdquo;</h4>
<p>In conclusion, I will say a few words about the name.&nbsp; In
the facsimile copy of Domesday it is Lothu Wistoft.&nbsp; In the
grant of the privileges of &ldquo;Ancient Demesne&rdquo; by
Elizabeth, which recites a certificate from Chancery that the
parish was in demesne of the Crown in the time of William the
Conqueror the name is spelt &ldquo;Lothn-wistoft.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Either spelling affords good evidence of the origin of the word,
and leaves little room for doubting its etymology.&nbsp;
Lothu-wistoft or Lothn-wistoft was the &ldquo;toft&rdquo; by
Loth-wis or Lothen-wis, or Lothing-wis, &ldquo;wis&rdquo; being
the same word as &ldquo;ouse,&rdquo; a word used in Saxon times
as an equivalent for &ldquo;lake,&rdquo; as in Wisbech, stagnant
or slow moving water, as distinguished from a quick running
river.&nbsp; The place was probably at first only called
&ldquo;toft,&rdquo; a very common word in Saxon times, denoting a
small homestead, and not uncommonly found in <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>existing
names&mdash;as &ldquo;Toft Monks,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Stowlangtoft,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; &ldquo;Loth-wis&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Lothn-wis&rdquo; was equivalent to &ldquo;Lothing
Lake,&rdquo; the piece of water which played the important part
of separating Lothing, or Lothingland, from the rest of the
county of Suffolk.&nbsp; The abbreviation of this long word into
a shorter form was inevitable, and as early as 1327 we find it
appearing in the Subsidy Rolls as &ldquo;Lowystofth.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The forms it took after this time are multitudinous, but the
later abbreviations and corruptions, due to vulgar pronunciations
and bad spelling, are no guide whatever to its original etymology
Lothing or Lothingland, Lothingaland, Loddingland,
Luddingland&mdash;was the &ldquo;ing&rdquo; or property of Loth,
Lod, or Lud, probably a Danish captain, to whom this district was
given by the Danish conquerors of East Anglia after it had been
settled in townships by the Angles (compare Kessingland,
&amp;c.)</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Part</span> I.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Lowestoft in the 14th Century</span>.</h3>
<p>Lowestoft lies hid in oblivion for some 300 years after her
appearance in Domesday.&nbsp; During this time great changes had
taken place in the country at large as well as in
Lowestoft.&nbsp; A new regime had been established, under which
Saxon and Angle, Dane and Norman, had been welded into one
nation, and laws and institutions were in force, which are
familiar features in our present legal and political
system.&nbsp; Although still 500 years from the present time,
England, in Edward III.&rsquo;s reign, was much more like the
England of to-day than the country described in Domesday.&nbsp;
Foreign trade had sprung up.&nbsp; Wheat and wool were grown in
large quantities and exported from Yarmouth and other
ports.&nbsp; The penny was no longer the only silver coin, and
gold coins of several different sizes and values were in
circulation.&nbsp; Last, and not least, the herring fishery was
being carried on to a very large extent on this coast, and was an
object of national and international importance.</p>
<p><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>It is
in the middle of Edward III.&rsquo;s reign that Lowestoft appears
for the second time in our national records.&nbsp; But she is no
longer the insignificant agricultural village of Domesday.&nbsp;
She is evidently a rising little town, in the modern sense of the
word, carrying on a sea trade of some importance in fish and
other light merchandise.&nbsp; She had ceased for some years to
be &ldquo;Royal demesne,&rdquo; and was now the property of the
King&rsquo;s cousin&mdash;John, Duke of Brittany and Earl of
Richmond&mdash;to whom the manor of Gorleston and the rest of the
Royal estates in this neighbourhood had been given by the
King&rsquo;s grandfather, Edward I.</p>
<p>It was at this time that she was brought into prominence by a
long Parliamentary contest with Yarmouth about the right to buy
and land herrings at Lowestoft from foreign and west country
fishermen anchored in the roads opposite her shore, then called
Kirkley Road.</p>
<p>That you may understand the full import of the circumstances
which brought about this contest with Yarmouth we must take a
glance at the history of that town up to that period.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Rise of Yarmouth</span>.</h4>
<p>The origin of Yarmouth is unique; the bar of a wide Estuary, a
sandbank in the sea, seized upon for human habitation before even
nature herself had trusted it with any vegetation beyond a few
patches of marram grass to bind the sand together.</p>
<p>Who the bold fishermen were&mdash;whether Angles or Danes
(probably Danes) who first dared to build cottages on such a site
we know not, nor when the occupation of this sandbank first
began.&nbsp; The name of the &ldquo;Cerdick Sands&rdquo; which
the Saxons had given it, implies that it was well above water in
the earliest part of the Saxon period, whether Cerdick did or not
pay his traditionary visit to this spot.&nbsp; It must have been
in that condition several years before the time of Edward the
Confessor, when, as we have already learnt from Domesday, <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>Yarmouth was
a town of some wealth and importance.&nbsp; The following well
approved tradition of the origin of Yarmouth is given by an old
writer (Jeakes) in his History of the Cinque Ports.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Beside the staple trade of these towns (the
Cinque Ports) consisting much in fishing, not only of fresh fish
at home, but of herring every year in the season thereof at
Yarmouth, where bringing them ashore in the sale and delivery
among the multitude, divers differences and stirs arose for want
of a settled order in that town, or as tradition still reports,
before there was any town or any show of a town than some huts
and cabins set up near the waterside like the booths and huts in
a fair; and that during the time of the herring fair there the
Ports were forced to agree and join together yearly to elect and
send thither their Bailiffs to abide there during the herring
season allowing them a certain sum for their expenses.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rapid growth of Yarmouth from a few fishermen&rsquo;s
&ldquo;huts and cabins&rdquo; to one of the most important and
populous sea ports in the country was evidently due to her great
natural advantages.&nbsp; She possessed a large and deep harbour,
with a long natural quay, the inside face of the sandbank.&nbsp;
Her position commanded the entrance to four rivers which were
navigable by light craft for many miles into Norfolk and
Suffolk.&nbsp; Last but not least the town was most conveniently
situated as a rendezvous for fishermen coming from the Cinque
ports, and other places in the South of England, as well as from
France and Holland to take part in the autumnal herring
harvest.</p>
<p>From William the Conqueror downwards our Kings were well aware
of the importance of Yarmouth, for the defence of the East Coast,
and of the value of the herring fishery.&nbsp; Charters and
ordinances were issued to regulate the autumnal Herring Fair, and
to insure its being conducted on strictly free-trade principles,
while the Yarmouth merchants made good use of their position as
the seat of the trade, and produced in a few years a fleet of
ships and sailors, which in Edward the III.&rsquo;s time was able
to take a leading part in our naval history.</p>
<p>We first hear of Yarmouth&rsquo;s naval exploits in her
quarrels with the Cinque Ports.&nbsp; After Yarmouth had obtained
&ldquo;Home <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>Rule&rdquo; under the charter of King John, she resented
being any longer nursed by the Barons of the Cinque Ports, in the
management of the autumnal Herring Fair, and she grudged the
rights given to the western fishermen to use her harbour and her
denes during the season for their own advantage.</p>
<p>In times when it was a common practice for Parliament and the
Crown to give special privileges to towns or other bodies,
without providing any adequate means for securing their
enjoyment, the practice of taking the law into your own hands,
which is proverbially a mistake in these days, was the only means
by which the possessors of privileges could maintain them, and
accordingly we find Yarmouth and the Cinque ports repeatedly
engaged in what can only be described as naval wars, arising from
some conflict in the provisions of their respective charters.</p>
<p>In 1281 Yarmouth was fined &pound;1,000 for doing divers
trespasses and damages to the Cinque Ports upon the south coast
as far as Shoreham, Portsmouth and other places.</p>
<p>In 1303 we find Yarmouth sending ships to join the Royal fleet
which was to escort Edward I. to Flanders.&nbsp; Having put the
King ashore the Yarmouth and the Cinque Ports men, being well
equipped for fight take the opportunity of paying off old scores
by engaging in a furious battle in which 25 Yarmouth ships were
burnt.&nbsp; According to another account 37 Yarmouth ships were
greatly damaged and &pound;15,000 worth of loss inflicted.</p>
<p>We have other evidence of Yarmouth&rsquo;s naval power in the
reign of Edward III.&nbsp; In 1337 Yarmouth supplies Edward III.
with 20 &ldquo;men of war&rdquo; (as they were called) to carry
the King&rsquo;s ambassadors to Hainault.&nbsp; On their return
they did a little privateering business on their own account and
took two Flemish ships laden with provisions for Scotland, and
killed the Bishop of Glasgow who was unfortunately on board one
of them.</p>
<p>In 1340 Yarmouth contributed 52 ships to the Fleet with <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>which Edward
won the battle of the Swin against France off Sluys in
Holland.&nbsp; The admiral of this fleet was John Perebrown, a
Yarmouth man, whose name appears some 15 times in the lists of
Bailiffs.&nbsp; Edward was particularly proud of this
victory.&nbsp; He had a new gold coinage issued to commemorate
it, the first nobles struck, bearing an effigy of himself sitting
in the middle of a ship, with a shield on his left arm bearing
the arms of England and France.</p>
<p>In 1342 Edward came himself to Yarmouth and sailed with a
fleet of 20 Yarmouth ships to the coast of Brittany, where he was
engaged in laying siege to the town of Vannes.&nbsp; Having
landed the king the Yarmouth ships are attacked by the French
fleet, and being worsted (doubtless by a superior force) they
take to flight leaving the king in the lurch.&nbsp; The king
having managed, with the assistance of the Pope, to make a truce
with France, comes home and at once summons all the owners as
well as the captains and the crews of the Yarmouth ships to
&ldquo;answer for their contemptibly deserting him, leaving other
our faithful subjects there with us in danger of our
lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The names of the ships and of all their owners and captains,
are entered in the Kings&rsquo; writ of summons <a
name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31"
class="citation">[31]</a> and they are required to attend with
all the sailors at Westminster.&nbsp; We do not hear of their
being punished.&nbsp; They probably were able to satisfy the King
that on this occasion discretion was the better part of valour,
and we find them fighting for the King again 5 years
afterwards.&nbsp; This was in 1347 when he was engaged in the
celebrated siege of Calais.</p>
<p>On this occasion Yarmouth contributed no less than 43 ships to
the Royal fleet and 1075 mariners, a larger number of ships and
men than even London supplied.</p>
<p>The importance of Yarmouth at this time and the magnitude of
it&rsquo;s fleet relative to that of other towns is shown by the
fact that the total number of ships which the Cinque Ports
themselves were required to supply was 57.</p>
<p><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>According to a statement in the petition of the town to
Henry VII., Yarmouth had at this time 80 ships with forestages
and 170 ships without.&nbsp; The larger ships were apparently
about the size of a 100 ton ship of the present day.</p>
<p>These records are interesting in themselves, and are important
episodes in our national history.&nbsp; I have quoted them for
the purpose of showing the magnitude and importance of Yarmouth
at this time.&nbsp; A town which could fit out 43 ships for the
King&rsquo;s Navy and man them with 1075 sailors at their own
cost, (for the King only paid for the maintenance of the sailors
while in his service), must have been both wealthy and
populous.&nbsp; She had acquired her wealth and naval power
almost entirely from the herring fishery, and from the large
extent to which her own population was engaged in it.&nbsp; But
the trade carried on by her merchants during the autumn season
with the fish catchers and fish buyers from other towns at home
and abroad contributed largely to the wealth of the town.&nbsp;
It appears from a return which has been preserved of the amount
taken for the murage tax, (a small charge on ships and
merchandise added to the harbour dues towards the expense of
building the town wall) that the amount received in the year 1343
during the weeks comprising the herring season was &pound;54 6s.
out of a total sum of &pound;66 7s. 11d. collected during the
twelve months.&nbsp; The entries show the large number of foreign
vessels coming to the Autumn Fair.&nbsp; In five days in
September in this year, 60 foreign ships entered the harbour, of
which 10 were from Lombardy. <a name="citation32"></a><a
href="#footnote32" class="citation">[32]</a></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Black Plague at Yarmouth</span>.</h4>
<p>It was when Yarmouth was in the height of her prosperity, and
the herring trade becoming more and more valuable owing to the
superstitious importance attached to the rules as to fasting,
that she was destined to suffer a ruinous collapse from which she
did not recover for several centuries, <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>and which deprived her for ever of
the position of eminence as a naval town which she had held
during the first half of the 14th century.&nbsp; The main cause
of her fall was the loss within the space of a few months of more
than half her population from the terrible epidemic known as the
Black Plague.&nbsp; Great as was the destruction of life from
this fell disease in other towns and parishes in the country,
there could have been no town where the destruction of life was
greater and the consequent impoverishment more felt.&nbsp;
Probably no town in England was more favourably conditioned for
the work of the destroyer.&nbsp; A large population of poor
fishermen and sailors were crowded together in small hovels,
closely packed within the walls, in double rows, separated by
narrow alleys of six feet or less in breadth.&nbsp; This
arrangement had evidently been adopted by the first occupants of
the storm-swept sandbank for convenience and warmth.&nbsp; But it
was an arrangement terribly conducive to the rapid spread of any
infectious disease which had once gained a footing in the
town.</p>
<p>In that year (1349), according to the account given a hundred
and fifty years afterwards by the town&rsquo;s people themselves
in a petition to Henry VII., more than half the population,
including many of its leading merchants fell victims to the
disease.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the 31st (sic) year of the reign of King
Edward the 3rd by a great visitation of Almighty God there was so
great death of people within the same towne that there was buried
in the parish church and church yard of the said towne in one
year 7052 men, by reason whereof the most part of the dwelling
places and the inhabitations of the said towne stode desolate,
and fell into utter ruin and decay, which at this day are gardens
and void grounds as evidently appeareth.&rdquo; <a
name="citation33"></a><a href="#footnote33"
class="citation">[33]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever may have been the exact population of Yarmouth at the
time of this terrible visitation (it could not have been more
than 10 or 12,000) it must have been a very different town after
1350 to what it was in the first half of the century, and
although the merchants might retain their hold upon the herring
trade, the loss of so large a part of <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>the fishing population must have made
them much more dependant upon their visitors for the supply of
fish in the autumn season than before.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Yarmouth Harbour Blocked Up</span>.</h4>
<p>But the loss of fishermen was not the only affliction from
which Yarmouth was to suffer.&nbsp; The continuance of her trade
and even of her very existence was in peril from the blocking up
of her harbour.&nbsp; During the whole period during which the
town was itself growing, from the time of the Conquest to that of
which we are now treating, the sandbank on which it was built was
being gradually extended southwards, enclosing the river, and
carrying its mouth further and further South, until at the
beginning of the 14th century the mouth of the Yarmouth Harbour
was opposite the Gunton Denes and within a mile of
Lowestoft.&nbsp; In a few more years the mouth of the Yare would
have been at Lowestoft, and Lowestoft would have occupied a more
favourable position for the trade of the Yare than Yarmouth
itself.&nbsp; Lowestoft had already taken advantage of the
opportunities which the nearness of the Harbour mouth gave her of
getting a share in the herring trade.&nbsp; The sea opposite her
shore then called &ldquo;Kirkley Road&rdquo; offered the same
resting place for wind-bound ships as it does now, and as the
mouth of the Haven was always in the condition of being more or
less blocked with sand, it only needed a little enterprise on the
part of Lowestoft people to get fishing boats bound for Yarmouth
to discharge their herrings on the Gunton denes, rather than
incur the certain loss of time in waiting for the tide to carry
them up to Yarmouth quay, and the danger of being wrecked at the
harbour mouth.</p>
<p>In the early part of the century, when Yarmouth was in her
most flourishing condition, she had both men and money, and she
had undertaken the first of her numerous efforts to remedy this
chronic trouble by cutting out a new mouth for her harbour.&nbsp;
This mouth, which was on the north side of <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>Corton, was
kept open for some 26 years.</p>
<p>Although during this time the herring trade carried on by
Yarmouth, with its harbour and Free Fair, was out of all
proportion to that of the seaside villages in its neighbourhood,
it is evident that Lowestoft and Winterton, and perhaps some of
the other villages, had taken part in the international trade of
the autumn season, besides catching herrings in their own
boats.</p>
<p>The rules as to fasting during Lent, as well as on Fridays and
Saturdays in every week during the year, which were strictly
enforced at this time by a powerful Church, had rendered the east
coast herring trade a matter of national importance.&nbsp; The
ability to purchase red herrings for lenten fare was a necessity
for the salvation, not only of the lives, but of the souls of the
people.&nbsp; Even our soldiers when engaged in war had to
observe the rules as to fasting.&nbsp; In 1358 we hear of 50
lasts of herring being shipped at Portsmouth for the use of the
army in France.&nbsp; In 1429 Sir John Fastolf was serving in the
Duke of Bedford&rsquo;s army at the siege of Orleans.&nbsp; Sir
John was himself of an old Yarmouth family.&nbsp; Several members
of his family were on the lists of bailiffs for the previous
century, and he is said to have had a house in Yarmouth as well
as his Castle at Caister near by.&nbsp; His connection with
Yarmouth probably enabled him to procure a supply of herrings for
the army not altogether without profit to himself.&nbsp; At all
events on Ash-Wednesday, 1429, he had charge of a train of 500
wagons of herrings on its way from Paris to Orleans.&nbsp; He was
attacked by a large force of French at a village near
Orleans.&nbsp; He had recourse to the tactics we have so often
heard of lately in our wars in South Africa.&nbsp; He formed his
wagons into laager, and from behind these defences the English
Archers shot their arrows with such deadly effect, that they
drove the enemy off with great slaughter, and Sir John got his
herrings safely into camp.&nbsp; This was the Battle of Herrings,
one of the most celebrated victories in the French wars.</p>
<p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>In
order to secure an abundant provision of herrings at a cheap
price, the Parliament of 1357 passed the well known Statute of
Herrings, which was aimed particularly at securing the conduct of
the Free Fair, and of the Yarmouth herring trade, in the
interests of the country at large.&nbsp; It is evident from the
preamble to this statute that it was aimed directly against the
practice of the Yarmouth merchants &ldquo;forestalling&rdquo; the
Fair by buying their herrings from the ships which anchored in
the roads outside the harbour mouth.</p>
<p>In order to prevent the Yarmouth merchants supplying
themselves by this means to the disadvantage of the general
purchaser at the Fair, the statute enacts that the fishers after
having supplied the &ldquo;London Pykers&rdquo; (a special
exception in favour of London)&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Shall bring all the remnant of their
herring to the said fair to sell there, so that none shall sell
herring in any place about the haven of Great Yarmouth by seven
&ldquo;Leues&rdquo; (Leuc&aelig; or Leagues) unless it be herring
of their own catching.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This prohibition against &ldquo;forestalling&rdquo; the Fair,
although aimed directly against the Yarmouth merchants
themselves, evidently applied equally to all persons coming from
Lowestoft, or any other place, to buy herrings from ships in
Kirkley Road.&nbsp; It was not, however, the intention of
Parliament at this time to give any monopoly to Yarmouth; and
within two years after the passing of this statute, we find that
an ordinance was issued expressly exempting Lowestoft and
Winterton from this prohibition.</p>
<p>This ordinance enacted that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If the fishers be in free will to sell
their herrings in the said road after they be anchored there, it
shall be lawful for the merchants of Lowestoft and Winterton to
buy herrings of the fishers, as free as the London pycards, to
serve their carts and horses that come thither from other
countries, and to hang there.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This would appear to be the earliest record in which Lowestoft
appears, since Domesday, which furnishes any evidence of her
having risen from the humble status she occupied at that
time.</p>
<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>Although this notice of Lowestoft does not imply that
Lowestoft in 1359 was a larger place than Winterton then was, it
shows very clearly that a trade in herrings, at all events during
the Autumnal season, had been established here, and that it was
considered of sufficient importance to deserve a special
ordinance permitting its continuance, notwithstanding the statute
of Herrings.&nbsp; It also tells us what the system of trade at
Lowestoft was at this time.&nbsp; Lowestoft men went out to the
foreign and other fishing boats when anchored in the roads, and
bought and landed herrings on the Denes.&nbsp; Here they were
sold to the &ldquo;peddlers&rdquo; or travelling fish merchants,
who, having loaded their pack horses and their carts, started off
homewards, to sell their fish as fresh as possible in distant
inland towns.</p>
<p>The last words of the proviso &ldquo;and to hang there&rdquo;
clearly authorised the Lowestoft merchants not only to buy fish
for resale, but to supply themselves with herrings for hanging in
their own fish houses.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Part</span> II.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Rise of Lowestoft</span>, <span class="smcap">and
Parliamentary War with Yarmouth</span>.</h3>
<p>The free trade policy of the Statute of Herrings had not the
desired effect of reducing the price of herrings, and the
condition of Yarmouth was getting worst.&nbsp; Her haven was
again becoming unnavigable, and merchants were leaving the
town.&nbsp; On the cliff, a mile south of the mouth of the
harbour, the little town of Lowestoft was growing up, and
beginning to take an important share in the trade on which
Yarmouth depended for her existence.&nbsp; It was under these
circumstances that Yarmouth petitioned the King to giant her a
charter which could protect her trade against the competition of
Lowestoft, and mitigate the evil caused by the blocking up of the
mouth of her harbour.</p>
<p><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>Edward
III. had every reason to befriend Yarmouth, and to prevent the
ruin of an important naval town.&nbsp; So in 1371 he issued a
Commission to enquire how far the charter demanded by Yarmouth
would be advantageous or disadvantageous to the country.&nbsp;
The Commission reported in favour of the grant, and in 1373 the
charter was granted which was to put the towns of Yarmouth and
Lowestoft at loggerheads for some 300 years, and involve them in
bouts of costly litigation.</p>
<p>The effect of the charter was to give Yarmouth two strings to
her bow against Lowestoft.</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; It annexed to Yarmouth the &ldquo;place in the high
seas called Kirkley Road&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> the whole of the
roads along the coast from Pakefield to the mouth of Yarmouth
harbour, wherever that might happen to be, and gave the Yarmouth
Bailiffs the right of taking the same tolls from ships
discharging cargo in any part of these roads, which they were
empowered to take from ships inside the harbour.</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; It prohibited the buying and selling of herrings
during the time of the Autumnal fair at any place on sea or land,
within &ldquo;7 leuc&aelig;&rdquo; of the town of Great Yarmouth,
except at the town itself, and gave the Bailiffs authority to
seize any ship &amp;c. from which any herrings were sold in
contravention of the charter.</p>
<p>As it was stated in the report of the Commission, on which
this charter was granted, that Lowestoft was 5
&ldquo;leuc&aelig;&rdquo; from Yarmouth, it is clear that it was
intended to include Lowestoft in the prohibition.&nbsp; It is
also clear than the word &ldquo;leuca&rdquo; was used to denote a
distance of nearly two miles.&nbsp; There was no legally
established measure of distance at this time.&nbsp; Our statute
mile was not established until 200 years afterwards, in Queen
Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign.</p>
<p>That the Yarmouth merchants had some reason to desire the
protection of their trade against the competition of Lowestoft,
is shown by a statement in a letter of complaint written from <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>Yarmouth to
the Barons of the Cinque Ports some years afterwards, in which
they are blamed for not enforcing the observance of the charter
by their own fishermen, and requiring them to take their fish to
Yarmouth, &ldquo;for if they can deliver at Lowestoft, they will
bring very few or none to us.&rdquo; <a name="citation39"></a><a
href="#footnote39" class="citation">[39]</a></p>
<p>Such being the intention of the Charter you will not be
surprised to learn that it met with strenuous opposition from
Lowestoft.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Lowestoft Men Prosecuted by the Yarmouth
Bailiffs for Contravention of this Charter</span>.</h4>
<p>When the foreign and west country fishing boats appeared in
the Roads in the autumn, and the Lowestoft men went out, as
usual, with their boats to buy herring from the ships at anchor
off the denes, officers appeared from Yarmouth armed with
authority from the Bailiffs, to enforce the new law, and to seize
any ships selling or discharging herrings in contravention of
their charter.&nbsp; They found a large number of Lowestoft men
purchasing herrings from ships within the prohibited area, but
instead of attempting to seize the ships, which was their proper
remedy under the charter, they took the more prudent course of
prosecuting the buyers, and some 25 Lowestoft men were summoned
before the Yarmouth Bailiffs.&nbsp; They met the indictment
brought against them by an appeal, and it was removed by writ of
certiorari to the King&rsquo;s court in Westminster Hall.&nbsp;
The indictment states, after reciting the charter,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That on Friday next after the feast of St.
Luke the Evangelist (18th October) John Botild of Lowestoft
bought of John Trampt of Ostend, an alien, in the said place
called Kirkley Road, which is within the 7 leuks, twenty-five
lasts of new herring (value 50 pounds.) and the said alien took
his boat, (value 20 shilling) out of the ship, and in the night
elongated himself (i.e. ran away) to his own proper house, and
hauled the boat ashore, so that the said bailiffs could not touch
the said herring, nor the boat, nor the ship, to arrest them,
because the aforesaid alien had by the advice of the said John
Botild elongated himself, nor could they thence by any means
answer it as a forteiture to the Lord the King.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The defence of the Lowestoft men was that the prohibited area
only extended as far as a place called &ldquo;Stampard&rdquo;
(the <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>Stanford channel?) construing the term
&ldquo;leuca&rdquo;, as equivalent to &ldquo;mile,&rdquo; (which
was the construction afterwards put upon it); and that the ships
from which they bought herrings were lying beyond this
distance.&nbsp; The trial of the appeal came on before the King
at Westminster Hall in the Spring term of 1374, but was adjourned
for further hearing; a proceeding caused probably by the
congested state of business in the Law Courts, an inconvenience
to suitors not unknown even at the present time.&nbsp; What the
end of the case was we are not informed, but it evidently went
against Lowestoft.&nbsp; Meanwhile the Lowestoft people had
appealed to another power.&nbsp; In 1376 they presented a
petition to Parliament for the repeal of the obnoxious
charter.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">First Revocation of Edward&rsquo;s
Charter to Yarmouth</span>.</h4>
<p>Their petition was supported by another from the Commons of
the counties of Suffolk, Essex, Cambridge, Huntingdon, Lincoln,
Northampton, Bedford, Bucks, Leicester and other counties.&nbsp;
Such was the importance to the country of our growing town at the
end of 14th century!!</p>
<p>Parliament made very short work of the business, and the King
was compelled to withdraw his charter.&nbsp; This he did in the
following somewhat ungracious terms&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Edward by the grace of God, King of England
&amp;c.&nbsp; Know ye that we, the liberties and privileges of
the Burgesses and good men of the town of Great Yarmouth lately
so by us given and granted, <i>at the suit and voluntary clamour
of certain people</i> alleging that those privileges and
liberties have been and are contrary to the profit of the
republic, and to us and our people prejudicial and hurtful, in
our Parliament holden at Westminister, &amp;c. have revoked and
totally made void.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a curious coincidence which adds much to the interest of
our story, that this petition from our old townspeople was one of
the several hundred introduced in this Parliament, which is known
in history as the &ldquo;Good Parliament&rdquo; owing to the
number of popular measures which were passed by it.&nbsp; The
popular Prince of Wales, Edward the Black Prince, was still
living, and the Commons had his support against the Crown party
led by his uncle, John of Gaunt.</p>
<p><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>In the
following year (1377) the old King dies, and Richard II., then a
boy of 11, becomes our ruler.&nbsp; Yarmouth lost no time in
taking advantage of the opportunity which the succession of a new
government offered for re-opening the question.&nbsp; She
succeeded in getting another Commission of enquiry which
apparently confined its labours to hearing the Yarmouth
case.&nbsp; Without hearing Lowestoft, they reported that
Yarmouth was a &ldquo;walled town capable of resisting the
King&rsquo;s enemies,&rdquo; but that Lowestoft was, &ldquo;not
inclosed and was incapable of defence.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
accordingly advised that Edward&rsquo;s charter should be
regranted.</p>
<p>The following Parliament (1378) was not held at Westminster as
usual.&nbsp; The popular Prince of Wales was dead; and John of
Gaunt and the Crown party were having their own way.&nbsp; It
appears that he had got into bad relations with the citizens of
London owing to the killing of a knight at Westminster by his
retainers, and he thought it safer under the circumstances that
the Commons should not be invited to meet there; so he got the
King to summon his Parliament to meet at Gloucester.&nbsp; At
such a distance the Commons of the Eastern Counties were not
likely to attend in their full numbers; nor were those who did
sit in this Parliament allowed to take the influential part in
its proceedings which they had taken in the previous
parliament.&nbsp; From these or other causes the Crown party had
their own way, and Yarmouth got its charter regranted and
confirmed.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Proclamation of the Charter at
Lowestoft</span>.</h4>
<p>The task was then imposed upon the under sheriff of Norfolk
and Suffolk of proclaiming the obnoxious law at Lowestoft.&nbsp;
How it was received appears from the sheriffs account of the riot
which took place on the occasion, for which May day seems to have
been selected, on account doubtless of it&rsquo;s being a
holiday, when his majesty&rsquo;s liege subjects of Lowestoft
would <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>be
able all to attend and listen to the royal proclamation.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On which day the aforesaid under sheriff at
Lowestoft attended to proclaim the aforesaid liberties and he
openly shewed the letters patent of the Lord the King on that
account, when there came Martin Terry, Stephen Shelford.&nbsp;
Henry Freeborn, and Emma his wife, John Spencer, and Alice his
wife, &amp;c. &amp;c. with a great company of men and women of
the town aforesaid of whose names they are ignorant by the
abetment and procurement of William Hannell, John Blower, Thomas
de Wade, Richard Skinner, William Large &amp;c., and violently
resisted and hindered him, some saying to the sheriff they would
not suffer him to depart, others forcing his letters from him and
saying (among other language used on the occasion which is
unfortunately or perhaps fortunately obliterated)&mdash;that if
he dared any more to come for any execution of the Lord the King
he should not escape.&nbsp; So that for fear of death he durst
not execute the writ aforesaid, and they drove him then and there
with a multitude of rioters, with hue and cry out of the town,
casting stones at the head of his men and servants to the
pernicious example and contempt of the Lord the King and against
his peace.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does loyal Lowestoft think of this behaviour of their old
town&rsquo;s people, in almost the first scene in which they
appear in the stage of history!!&nbsp; It is evident from this
story that there were two classes represented in this riot, a
large number of people men and women, who took an active part in
it, and several leading persons, the merchants probably of the
period, who &ldquo;procured and abetted&rdquo; them.</p>
<p>The treatment which the king&rsquo;s proclamation and the
under-sheriff met with at Lowestoft, was duly inquired into by
the sheriff, but we are not informed of the punishment enforced
upon the rioters.&nbsp; The Lowestoft people, however, lost no
time in making another appeal for the assistance of the
Commons.&nbsp; On this occasion they were supported by the
Commons of the county of Norfolk, as well as by those of
Suffolk.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Charter Revoked a Second
Time</span>.</h4>
<p>Another commission of enquiry was appointed in 1380 under the
presidency of the Chief Justice Tresilian, who sat with his
colleagues, representing Lowestoft and Yarmouth, one day at
Norwich and on the second at Lowestoft, and heard evidence on
behalf of each town.&nbsp; This Commission reported in favour of
Lowestoft, and in the following year the Parliament, sitting at
<a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>Westminster, repealed the grant, and the young king was
compelled to follow the course taken by his grandfather, and
declared his charter to be &ldquo;revoked and utterly made
void&rdquo; (1381).</p>
<p>Yarmouth however had too much confidence in her claim on the
Crown to give up the struggle, and the next year she again
petitions the King to restore her charter.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Charter Regranted a Third
Time</span>.</h4>
<p>The young King now 17 years old, was so anxious to learn the
merits of the important contest, that he himself paid a visit to
Yarmouth in 1382.&nbsp; We do not hear that he came to Lowestoft,
or that he ascertained the precise position of &ldquo;the place
called Kirkley Road.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was probably shown the town
walls, and the devastation caused by the plague, (which the
Yarmouth people seem to have attributed to the repeal of their
charter).&nbsp; He and his courtiers were feasted by the Bailiffs
and Burgesses, with the same judicious munificence, with which
200 years afterwards they treated Leicester and the other
noblemen of Elizabeth&rsquo;s court, when she was staying at
Norwich, and was invited to visit Yarmouth, under very similar
circumstances.&nbsp; Richard was much impressed with what he saw
and was told at Yarmouth, particularly that &ldquo;a great part
of the people had left the town on account of their charter
having been repealed,&rdquo; and in 1384 he took upon himself to
issue an ordinance re-granting the charter until the next sitting
of Parliament.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Charter Revoked a Third
Time</span>.</h4>
<p>In 1385 the Parliament met at Westminster.&nbsp; The Commons
were still staunch in their support of Lowestoft, and the King
was again compelled to revoke his ordinance, and to declare that
all the charters given to Yarmouth by his grandfather and himself
were utterly void.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">A New Charter Granted by
Richard</span>.</h4>
<p>The next year, however, from causes of which we are not
informed, we find that a great change took place in the
conditions <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>of the contest.&nbsp; In the Parliament of 1386 we find
the Commons themselves supporting the cause of Yarmouth, and
petitioning the crown to regrant their charter, notwithstanding
the persistency with which they had opposed it in previous
years.&nbsp; The King of course acceded at once to this petition,
and a new charter was granted to Yarmouth, embracing all the
provisions of the charter of Edward, and welding more tightly the
fetters which were intended to crush the trade of Lowestoft.</p>
<p>This charter has never been revoked and in 1826 it was cited
by the Town Clerk of Yarmouth before the committee of the House
of Commons, when the Bill for making a harbour at Lowestoft was
under consideration.</p>
<p>This game of see-saw between Crown and Parliament with
reference to the Yarmouth Charter, was an episode in the struggle
which was going on between these Powers during the whole of the
14th century and which forms an important chapter in our
constitutional history.&nbsp; The result of the contest as
regards the fortunes of the two towns would seem to have been a
complete triumph for Yarmouth; involving restrictions on the
trade of Lowestoft, which were intended to deprive it of any
share in the herring trade, beyond the produce of their own
fishing boats.&nbsp; This however was by no means the actual
result.&nbsp; The obnoxious charter proved to be perfectly
harmless to Lowestoft, if not entirely useless to Yarmouth.&nbsp;
It was beyond the power of Yarmouth to enforce it
effectually.&nbsp; The statue of Herrings, forbidding the
&ldquo;forestalling&rdquo; of the Free Fair by buying herrings
from ships at sea, applied to the Yarmouth merchants as well as
to Lowestoft men.&nbsp; The anomalous right given to the Yarmouth
Bailiffs of exacting harbour dues from ships anchored in the sea,
at a distance of several miles from their harbour mouth, must
have been incapable of enforcement, without a fleet of armed
bailiffs.&nbsp; It would appear that Yarmouth made little or no
attempt to enforce the provisions of the charter against
Lowestoft merchants buying herrings within the 7 leuc&aelig;, and
contented themselves with claiming <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>harbour dues from the ships which
discharged their herrings there.&nbsp; In this claim they had for
some years the assistance of the Lowestoft merchants themselves,
who undertook to farm the tolls of the town.&nbsp; They paid as
much as &pound;26 a year for these tolls in the years
1393&ndash;4&ndash;6.&nbsp; This blackmail was, however, soon
reduced, and in a few years the task of collecting the tolls was
left in the hands of the Yarmouth Bailiffs themselves.</p>
<p>In 1400 we find Yarmouth giving up altogether the attempt to
enforce their charter, and entering into an agreement with
Lowestoft, which gave express sanction to their purchasing
herrings from ships lying off their shore.&nbsp; This agreement
was entitled &ldquo;An accord or composition between Yarmouth and
Lowestoft that the latter might buy herrings in Kirkley Road upon
conditions therein specified.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Lowestoft
merchants were allowed to buy fish from all ships that were not
&ldquo;hosted&rdquo; to Yarmouth merchants i.e., from ships whose
owners had not entered into engagements with Yarmouth merchants
to sell their fish to them, or through them, as their agents (an
arrangement, very necessary for foreigners in those days); and
the Lowestoft merchants might buy also from these ships herrings
which the Yarmouth &ldquo;hosts&rdquo; did not require for
themselves, upon payment of half a mark per last to the hosts, in
addition to the price of the fish.&nbsp; This
&ldquo;Composition&rdquo; was formally sanctioned by the King in
Council, and was issued by &ldquo;Letters patent&rdquo; in the
2nd. year of Henry IV.&nbsp; As we do not hear of any further
litigation between Lowestoft and Yarmouth for 200 years, we may
take it that the first contest between the two towns was closed
by this agreement, whether this long truce was due to it, or to
other causes.</p>
<p>Swinden in his history of Yarmouth ends here his story of
&ldquo;The Contest about Kirkley Road.&rdquo;&nbsp; He promised
another chapter in which he would have had to deal with the
renewal of the contest by Yarmouth in the 16th and again in the
17th centuries.&nbsp; This chapter was not written.&nbsp; He
probably found a difficulty in treating the later episodes of the
story, which must have <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>been a very sore subject between the
two towns even when he was writing.</p>
<p>Our interest in it is now purely arch&aelig;ological.&nbsp;
The story though somewhat tedious cannot be dispensed with in a
history of Lowestoft, any more than the ghost&rsquo;s story in
Hamlet.&nbsp; It is the story of the growth of Lowestoft from a
small village into a fishing town of some importance to the
country.&nbsp; Her trade was probably growing rapidly during the
whole period that the contest lasted.&nbsp; But from the
beginning of the 15th century her merchants were free to take
their full share in the herring trade, and in any other trade,
which the position of the town would enable them to develope;
though without a harbour, her merchants, whether as fishing
adventurers, or as general merchants, must have had a very
limited range for their enterprises.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Part</span> III.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Evidence Furnished by the Lay Subsidies of the
Growth of Lowestoft</span>.</h3>
<p>Unfortunately the records of the contest between Yarmouth and
Lowestoft furnish us with no information as to the actual wealth
and population of Lowestoft at this period, and we have no local
records to help us in forming an estimate of either.&nbsp; But we
are not altogether at a loss for information on these important
questions.&nbsp; Among the decayed and fragmentary relics of the
old Lay Subsidy Rolls in the Record office, we have a complete
detailed return for the 1st of Edward III., and another for the
15th of Henry VIII.&nbsp; If these Rolls do not furnish direct
information as to the actual wealth and population of the town, a
comparison between them furnishes good evidence of its relative
status at these two periods.</p>
<p>Taking the Subsidy returns for 1327 from the same group of
parishes, whose condition at the time of Domesday we have already
noticed, we find that Yarmouth heads the list with a <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>contribution
of &pound;18. 8. 1.&nbsp; Beccles follows, with a contribution of
&pound;12. 4. 9.&nbsp; Gorleston, with Little Yarmouth, comes
next with a payment of &pound;10. 0. 4.&nbsp; Then Kessingland
follows with a payment of &pound;4. 2.&nbsp; No other parish in
the Hundred pays as much as &pound;2. 10.&nbsp; Mutford, Belton,
Carlton, and Corton pay &pound;2. and upwards.&nbsp; Gisleham and
Rushmere together pay &pound;2. 10., and Pakefield and Kirkley
are bracketed for &pound;2. 1.&nbsp; Blundeston pays &pound;1.
18., Somerleyton &pound;1. 17., Bradwell &pound;1. 14., and
Oulton and Flixton together &pound;1. 15.&nbsp; <i>Then comes
Lowestoft</i>, <i>with the humble contribution of &pound;1.
9.</i>, <i>gathered from 29 of its inhabitants</i>.&nbsp; Lound,
Fritton, Hopton, Gunton, Herringfleet, Burgh, and Ashby complete
the lists with sums rising from 16s. to &pound;1. 8.&nbsp; We can
but infer from these returns that Lowestoft had not yet made any
substantial advance upon the position she occupied in the
Domesday survey.&nbsp; The small contribution which she is called
upon to make, compared with Carlton Colville and Kessingland,
proves conclusively that at the beginning of Edward III.&rsquo;s
reign she had not developed any trade in herrings or any other
merchandise.&nbsp; Thirty years after (as we have already seen)
the little town was of sufficient importance to be honoured by
the issue of a Royal ordinance authorising her people to buy and
land herrings in Kirkley Road.&nbsp; We can thus fix the date of
the origin of Lowestoft as a town, in the modern sense of the
word, within a year or two.&nbsp; If the Subsidy Rolls for the
rest of this and the succeeding reigns were not defective, we
should probably find that the assessment of Lowestoft rose
rapidly during the latter half of the 14th century, and continued
to rise throughout the next century, and at least the first half
of the 16th century, so that at the time of the second Roll she
had reached nearly, if not quite her full growth as a town of
ancient times.</p>
<p>In the Roll for 1525 we find Lowestoft occupying an entirely
different position with respect to her agricultural
neighbours.&nbsp; Instead of appearing as a poor village of less
taxable capacity than Somerleyton and Blundeston we find <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>her
contributing a larger amount to the subsidy for this year than
all the rest of the Lothingland parishes together, even including
Gorleston and Southtown.&nbsp; <i>The contribution from Lowestoft
is &pound;29</i>, <i>just 20 times what it was in 1327</i>.&nbsp;
This sum was collected from 140 of her inhabitants; but there is
abundant evidence from other returns that the number of persons
entered as contributories in these rolls did not represent the
whole number of taxable people in the town and parish upon which
the subsidy was charged.&nbsp; The sum claimed by the Sheriff had
to be collected and paid in by the parish constables, who were
themselves among the larger contributors, but it was left to
them, with the concurrence of the people themselves, to arrange
by whom and in what proportions each person should contribute to
each subsidy.&nbsp; Taken year by year, the burden of these
subsidies was probably fairly distributed.&nbsp; The richer
inhabitants probably contributed to every subsidy, but the power
of excusal could be freely exercised by the constables in the
case of the poorer townspeople.&nbsp; This subsidy roll not only
gives us the names and payments of each contributor, but the
assessment of his property on which he was charged.&nbsp; The
total assessment amounted to about &pound;760, of which
&pound;710 was on &ldquo;movabyll goods,&rdquo; and &pound;50 on
&ldquo;wages and profits.&rdquo;&nbsp; Among the higher
assessments are:&mdash;John Hodden &pound;100, Robert Bach
&pound;50, John Goddard &pound;48, J. Jettor, jun. &pound;48,
Thomas Woods &pound;40, William French &pound;40, Robert Chevyr
(one of the parish constables) &pound;20.&nbsp; The other
assessment range from &pound;1 to &pound;19.&nbsp; Sir John
Browne&mdash;the Vicar&mdash;was assessed at &pound;7.&nbsp;
There is no assessment under &pound;1.&nbsp; The number assessed
at the lowest rate is 59:&mdash;23 are assessed at &pound;2.</p>
<p>The name at the head of the list is John Jettor, jun.&nbsp; He
had evidently been previously assessed at &pound;100 or
more.&nbsp; <i>He was only assessed on &pound;48 for this
subsidy</i>, &ldquo;<i>the consideration for his decay being that
he had lost a ship on the sea</i>, <i>pryce</i>
&pound;50.&rdquo;&nbsp; As these assessments purported to
represent the value of the &ldquo;movabyll goods&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i> all the <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>personal property possessed by the contributors, and as
the ship which John Jettor, junior, lost was valued at &pound;50,
<i>a larger sum than the rest of his</i> &ldquo;<i>movabyll
goods</i>&rdquo; <i>were valued at</i>, we can form some idea of
the amount of personal property possessed by the <i>richest
merchants</i> of the town at this period.</p>
<p>We have another entry of a similar kind.&nbsp; John Robinson
is only assessed at 40s. to this subsidy, because he had lost a
ship valued at &pound;28 &ldquo;captured by the
Scots.&rdquo;&nbsp; We can only infer from this that this ship
represented almost the whole of his property.&nbsp; We know from
another record that at this time our merchants possessed 14 barks
or doggers which used to go to Iceland to catch cod fish and
ling, besides smaller boats employed in fishing near home.&nbsp;
John Jettor&rsquo;s ship was probably one of these barks, and
John Robinson&rsquo;s&mdash;a small fishing boat.</p>
<p>It is clear from these entries that at this time a ship
represented a large part of the &ldquo;movabyll goods&rdquo; of
our richer townspeople.&nbsp; The value of two barks would equal
the highest assessment on this roll.&nbsp; When we consider the
dangers these ships incurred, not only from the sea, but from the
&ldquo;Scots&rdquo; and other occasional enemies, we can realise
the precarious condition of the property possessed by these
&ldquo;fishing adventurers,&rdquo; and of the town whose fortunes
depended on the success of their enterprises.&nbsp; It may be
inferred, however, from this and other evidence that the
assessments to the King&rsquo;s subsidies were very much of a
conventional character.&nbsp; They doubtless represented the
taxable capacity of the contributors relative to each other, but
we may feel quite certain that they did not represent the full
value of any persons property.&nbsp; The assessments were
practically made by the townspeople themselves, and they would be
each and all strongly interested in keeping the aggregate
assessment at as low a figure as possible.&nbsp; At the same
time, as the returns were subject to the inspection of the
Sheriff, as well as the Exchequer Court in London, the range for
imposition was <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>limited.&nbsp; The contributions were assessed on the
system of a &ldquo;graduated income tax.&rdquo;&nbsp; Persons
possessed of goods above &pound;20 in value paid 1s. in the
&pound;.&nbsp; Those possessing &ldquo;movabyll goods,&rdquo; or
taxed on &ldquo;wages and profits&rdquo; under that amount, paid
6d. in the &pound;.&nbsp; But the working men and fishermen who
were assessed at only 20s. for &ldquo;wages and profits&rdquo;
paid only 4d.&nbsp; No one was assessed at a lower sum than
20s.&nbsp; But 20s. could not represent the annual income of even
the lowest paid labourer.&nbsp; According to Mr. Thorold Rogers
the wages of the artizan at this time would be 3s. a week, or
some &pound;7 a year, and the wages of the agricultural labourer
2s. a week or about &pound;5 a year.&nbsp; Even this would be
much more than double the lowest assessment.&nbsp; We can hardly
believe that the richer men undertook a much larger share of the
burden than their property demanded, and we may reasonably infer
that their assessments did not represent the full value of their
property.&nbsp; But anyhow our richest merchants of those days
must have been very poor men according to our modern ideas.</p>
<p>Lowestoft was of course still a very small town as compared
with Yarmouth.&nbsp; As Yarmouth was exempted from all taxes
during Henry VIII.&rsquo;s reign on account of the expenses of
her harbour, the Subsidy Rolls do not enable us to compare the
wealth of the two towns.&nbsp; It was stated in one of their
petitions about this time that a &ldquo;whole Fifteenth&rdquo;
would amount to &pound;100.&nbsp; Beccles was also at this time a
much larger town than Lowestoft.&nbsp; In the Subsidy Roll for
the previous year (1523) the town paid &pound;73 13s. 4d., an
increased payment, it is stated, of &pound;33 4s. on a previous
assessment.&nbsp; Beccles was evidently a rising town at this
time, as well as Lowestoft.&nbsp; It was about this time, that
the detached tower of Beccles church was begun: its building took
40 years.&nbsp; On the other hand Winterton, joined with
Lowestoft in the ordinance of Edward III., was already left far
behind.&nbsp; Her contribution to the subsidy for 1524 was only
&pound;3 4s.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">A Market Held at Lowestoft</span>.</h4>
<p>It was in the early part of the 15th Century that Lowestoft
first possessed a market.&nbsp; William de la Pole, Earl of
Suffolk, <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>had succeeded John of Brittany in the ownership of the
old Royal demesnes in Lothingland.&nbsp; He obtained a grant from
Henry IV. to hold a market and two annual fairs in the
town.&nbsp; The market was doubtless held in the &ldquo;Old
Market&rdquo; Place, which still retains its title.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Parish Church</span>.</h4>
<p>It was undoubtedly at some time during this period, that is to
say, during the 15th or the first half of the 16th century, that
our present parish church was built, but we have neither record
or relic to fix the precise date of any part of its
structure.&nbsp; To a certain extent the church tells its own
tale.&nbsp; The style of architecture of the nave and aisles
prove them to have been built during the Perpendicular period;
during which period nearly all the most beautiful churches in
Norfolk and Suffolk were built.&nbsp; The unfortunate arrangement
by which this grand specimen of a Perpendicular church was tacked
on to the small tower of an older church, shows very clearly that
the reconstruction of the body of the church was undertaken to
meet the requirements of an increased population.&nbsp; From what
we now know of the state of the town in the 14th century, we can
hardly suppose that the re-building and enlargement of the older
church took place so early; even supposing that its Perpendicular
style would admit of its having been built in the latter part of
that century.&nbsp; From the tradition of the existence of an old
inscription in the church to &ldquo;Robert Inglosse, <i>Esq.</i>,
<i>which</i> died in anno 1365&rdquo; (an evident misreading),
Gillingwater and the Guide Books inform us that the church must
have been built before that date&mdash;&ldquo;probably soon after
1230&rdquo;&mdash;a hundred years and more before the
Perpendicular style was introduced.&nbsp; The existence however
of tombstones, with inscriptions of the 14th century, in the new
church, could easily be explained by their having been kept or
re-placed in the new building.&nbsp; In order to explain the
marvel that such a spacious and beautiful church should have been
erected at such an early period, it has been customary to call in
aid a purely imaginary factor, and to attribute its building to
the munificence <a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>of St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s Priory, to whom Henry I. had
given the great tithes of the parish.&nbsp; In the 13th century
these tithes were valued at seven marks, or about &pound;14 of
our present money.&nbsp; In the 14th, or even in the 16th
century, the value of these tithes could hardly have increased to
such an amount as would suggest to the most liberal-minded monks
that it was their duty to build a church for the parish in return
for the income they received from it.&nbsp; Dr. Jessop, in a
recent article in the &ldquo;Nineteenth Century,&rdquo; has
ridiculed the notion of monks building parish churches; and
certainly the connection between monasteries and parish church
property does not favour the view that they often felt it their
duty to apply these funds to the building of any other churches
than those attached to their own abbeys and priories.&nbsp; Dr.
Jessop&rsquo;s view is that our parish churches were built by the
parishioners themselves.&nbsp; I assume that he would include in
the &ldquo;parishioners&rdquo; the owners of property in a
parish, whether resident or not.&nbsp; Where the founder&rsquo;s
name has not been handed down to posterity this probably was the
case, and from what we know of the condition of our old town in
the time of Henry VIII., we can have no reason to doubt their
ability to incur the expense at that period (great as the expense
must have been, even when labourers&rsquo; wages where at 4d. or
5d. a day), particularly when we bear in mind the powerful
influence of the doctrine of good works in securing legacies for
such an object.&nbsp; Nor was the new church built all at
once.&nbsp; The aisles do not appear to have been built at the
same time, and the chancel appears to have been an after
addition, as well as the south porch.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Old Chapels</span>.</h4>
<p>There appear to have been two chapels in the town at this
time, which the people could attend while the parish church was
closed&mdash;a very little one, the chapel of the &ldquo;Good
Cross&rdquo; at the south end of the town, and a larger one in
the centre of the town, which was replaced after the Reformation
by a Protestant chapel.&nbsp; This chapel, after having been
restored and enlarged <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>in the 17th century, was in use until
St. Peter&rsquo;s Chapel was built, when it was given over to
secular uses, and has been since appropriated by our Corporation
as their Council Chamber.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Other Structural Relics</span>.</h4>
<p>We have a few other structural relics still surviving in very
much their original condition, which belong to this
period&mdash;probably to the early part of the 15th
century.&nbsp; These are the old vaulted cellars, which are to be
seen under houses near the Town Hall.&nbsp; There is nothing in
these structures to fix precisely the time when they were built;
but they have all the character of the 14th and 15th
centuries.&nbsp; The bricks of which the groins are made are
small and roughly moulded, and would appear to belong to an early
date after the revival of brick-making&mdash;a trade which seems
to have been beyond the capabilities of our ancestors from the
time the Romans left the country to the beginning of the 14th
century.&nbsp; The bricks in these cellars are similar to those
which are to be seen in the Yarmouth walls, which we know were
placed there in 1336, and which we are informed by old records
cost 20s. a last&mdash;the cost of two bricks being equal to that
of one red herring at the time.&nbsp; There are vaulted cellars
under old houses in Norwich very similar to those at
Lowestoft.&nbsp; A large cellar of this kind is to be seen in
good preservation under the house known as &ldquo;The Old
Bridewell,&rdquo; it having been used until comparatively recent
times as an underground prison.&nbsp; This house was built by
William Applegard, the first Mayor of Norwich, in 1404.&nbsp; The
Lowestoft cellars were evidently the basements of separate
houses; although near each other they are entirely
disconnected.&nbsp; They are much smaller, and the groins less
strongly constructed than those in the Mayor&rsquo;s house at
Norwich.&nbsp; The houses above them would also have been much
smaller.&nbsp; The doorways into these cellars are arched, and
not very long ago an ancient house was in existence above one of
these cellars.&nbsp; This house had an arched doorway, which with
the vaulted cellars underneath&mdash;so like the crypts of old
churches, induced the belief that <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>these houses had a monastic or
ecclesiastic origin.&nbsp; The doorways in the Mayors house at
Norwich were of the same form.&nbsp; Such features were common in
houses of this period, and in no way imply any monastic
origin.&nbsp; We cannot infer from the three specimens of these
cellars that survive, that there were many houses of this
character in our old town, nor from what we know of the wealth of
our merchants at this time, can we suppose that there were many
who could indulge in expensively-constructed cellars, however
convenient they might be for storing their &ldquo;movabyll
goods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We know well that Lowestoft in these old days was not what we
see now, but it is as difficult to substitute any clear idea of
what she was, as for a grown up man to picture himself when
running about in a short frock.&nbsp; In order to form a
tolerably correct idea of what our old town was at the beginning
of the 15th century, we must dismiss altogether from our
mind&rsquo;s eye the large populous town with which we are
acquainted, and picture to ourselves a village of small cottages
with thatched roofs being gradually improved by the erection of
houses of a better class.&nbsp; At the early part of Henry
VIII.&rsquo;s reign Lowestoft appears to have been a small town
on the cliff, containing some 20 or 30 merchants&mdash;in a very
small way of business&mdash;the richer men among them owning one
or two ships; most of them having fish-houses at the bottom of
the cliffs, and doing a good deal of business during the autumn
season in buying fish from the foreign and west-country fishermen
in the Roads, and selling it to fish merchants coming from inland
towns.&nbsp; They would also be doing a little business with
their visitors in light merchandise, which could be brought in
the fishing boats, or taken away after the season was over.&nbsp;
Profit would also be made during the season in victualling the
visitors&rsquo; ships.&nbsp; A few handicraft tradesmen and
shopkeepers and a number of working men and sailors would
complete the adult population.&nbsp; In fact the town would be
very much what it was some 60 years afterwards in
Elizabeth&rsquo;s time, which will be the subject of our next
lecture.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Part</span> I.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">The Parish Register</span>.</h3>
<p>Much light has been thrown on the character of Lowestoft some
300 years ago by the copies of the parish register, published in
the &ldquo;Parish Magazine,&rdquo; which, I doubt not, many of
you have been in the habit of studying.&nbsp; The existing parish
register dates back to 1561.&nbsp; The first volume of the book,
so to speak, which would tell us who were living or dying in
Lowestoft in the reigns of Henry VIII., Edward VI., and Mary, was
unfortunately burnt in the fire which destroyed the old vicarage
house in 1606.&nbsp; The register was kept from 1561 to 1583 by
Mr. Benjamin Allen, the parish clerk.&nbsp; From this year to the
end of our period it was kept by Mr. Stephen Philip, the first
master of Mr. Annott&rsquo;s school, of whom we shall speak again
soon.&nbsp; Mr. Allen was probably one of the few persons in
Lowestoft at the time who could write&mdash;at least, well enough
to undertake such an important and responsible task.&nbsp; I
cannot say much for his spelling, but variety rather than
uniformity in spelling was as yet a fashion of the day.&nbsp; He
belonged apparently to one of the upper, or as they would have
said, one of the &ldquo;bettermost&rdquo; families in the town,
which produced one of our naval heroes of the following
century.</p>
<p>But Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign was long long ago.&nbsp; We
know from books the principal events of her reign, as we do of
some period in Roman or Grecian History.&nbsp; But we know little
of the people, although we are of the same flesh and blood, and
indebted to them for much that we now enjoy.&nbsp;
Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign covered the first 42 years of our Parish
Registers; and the materials for this lecture will belong almost
entirely to this period.</p>
<p><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>As a
stepping stone however and introduction to our subject, I propose
to read to you a few lines from an account of a tour in these
parts taken by a young lady about 200 years ago; a hundred years
later than Elizabeth&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; This lady was Miss Celia
Fiennes, a daughter of Lord Saye and Sele.&nbsp; She appears to
have been quite a &ldquo;new woman&rdquo; of the 17th century,
and, I think I may safely say, the first lady who ever travelled
through England as a tourist.&nbsp; She rode on horseback.&nbsp;
She did not ride a bicycle for two reasons&mdash;first, because
they were not made then; and secondly, because if they had been,
there was no road on which they could have run a yard.&nbsp; This
absence of roads is an important point to bear in mind, for it
had much to do with the difference in the habits and character of
these old people and of ourselves.&nbsp; Miss Fiennes rode along
the roads and lanes, such as they were, accompanied by two male
servants, and stayed at inns and country houses.&nbsp; In her
tour through Suffolk and Norfolk she came from Ipswich, through
Saxmundham, to Beccles, and this is a little of what she tells us
about her journey:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thence to Saxmunday, eight miles
more.&nbsp; This is a pretty big market town.&nbsp; The wayes are
pretty deep, mostly lanes, very little commons.&nbsp; I passed by
several gentlemen&rsquo;s seats.&nbsp; So to Bathford (she meant
Blythburgh), eight miles, where is the remains of the walls of an
abbey, and there is still a very fine church, &amp;c.&nbsp;
Thence I paused by some woods and little villages of a few
scattered houses, and generally the people here are able to give
so bad a direction that passengers are at a loss what way to
take.&nbsp; They know scarce three miles from their home, and
meete them where you will, and enquire how far to such a place,
they tell you so farre, which is the distance from their own
homes to that place.&nbsp; To Beckle is eight miles more, which,
in all, was 36 miles from Ipswich, but exceeding long
miles.&nbsp; They do own they are 41 measured miles.&nbsp; This
is a little market town, but it is the third biggest town in
Suffolk&mdash;Ipswich, Berrye, and this.&nbsp; There are no good
buildings in the town, being old timber and plaster work, except
Sir R. Rich&rsquo;s, and one or two more.&nbsp; There is a bigg
market Kross and a market kept.&nbsp; At the town&rsquo;s end one
posses over the river Waveney, on a wooden bridge railed with
timber, and so you enter into Norfolk.&nbsp; Its a low, flat
ground all here about, so that at the least rains they are
overflowed by the river, and lie under water, as they did when I
was there; so that the road lay under water, which is very unsafe
for strangers to pass, by reason of the holes and quick-sands and
loose bottom.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the houses in Beccles, and the roads across the marshes
were as she describes them in the reign of William and <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>Mary, we may
be quite sure that they were no better in the time of her great
grandmother.&nbsp; We will imagine a traveller of this still more
ancient time arriving at Beccles on his way to Norwich, and who
finding the road across the marshes to Gillingham quite
impassable from the floods, determined to make a detour and pay a
visit to Lowestoft.</p>
<p>In travelling from Beccles to Lowestoft, our ancient visitor
would have no dangerous marsh roads to travel on.&nbsp; He would
ride along on the high ground which skirted the fenlands on the
north, on a road or trackway which had been used for hundreds of
years before, probably by Britons, Romans, and Saxons, and which
was the connecting link between Lothingland and Suffolk; the road
that still leads over the narrow ridge or neck between Lake
Lothing and Oulton Broad through Oulton to Burgh Castle and
Gorleston.</p>
<p>When our ancient visitor arrived at this spot, he would find a
narrow raised &ldquo;causey,&rdquo; as he would call it, (or as
we still more erroneously call it &ldquo;causeway&rdquo;) and a
bridge, <a name="citation57"></a><a href="#footnote57"
class="citation">[57]</a> the first bridge built over the little
gap which used to be known as the &ldquo;mud ford,&rdquo; and
from which the bridge took its name.&nbsp; Taking a survey from
this point, he would see on his left Oulton Fen, as it was then
called, a watery wilderness of reeds and bogs, much valued by the
sportsman and poachers of the period for fish and wildfowl, and
undisturbed by wherries or any craft beyond the fisherman&rsquo;s
punt.&nbsp; On the right would be Lake Lothing&mdash;the
&ldquo;fresh water,&rdquo; as the Lowestoft people then called
it, a long, river-like piece of water, with deep margins of reeds
and rushes, and as full of fish as Oulton Fen, with which it was
connected.&nbsp; Turning off the main road, into the road leading
to Lowestoft, he would soon come to Normanston&mdash;very much
then, I expect, what it is now.&nbsp; The gentleman living in it
then was apparently Mr. Mason, Churchwarden in 1575.&nbsp;
Several persons appear in the register as servants of Mr. Mason
buried during our period.&nbsp; Further on he would see the farm
by the church, <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>much the same as now, except in the character of the
buildings, and then the church&mdash;very much, indeed, the same,
except that it was then in very bad repair.&nbsp; It probably had
not been restored since it was built some 100 years or more
before.&nbsp; In 1592, in the latter part of our period, the
inhabitants undertook the task of repairing it, at the expense of
some &pound;200.&nbsp; The churchyard would be much the
same&mdash;quite full of graves&mdash;but with few
headstones.&nbsp; Close to the churchyard our ancient visitor
would see the old vicarage, which was burned down in 1606.&nbsp;
It was occupied during the first part of our period by Mr.
Nayshe, the minister of the parish, and afterwards by Mr.
Bentley, the Vicar of whom I shall tell you more soon.&nbsp;
Close to the Vicarage our visitor would see Annott&rsquo;s School
house, in which Mr. Philip&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Annott, his
schoolmaster,&rdquo; as he was always to be called according to
the deed of endowment, was then living, of whom also more
soon.&nbsp; This house has also long since disappeared.&nbsp; He
would then reach the town, passing from Church Road into what was
then Swan Lane (now Mariners&rsquo; Street).&nbsp; Arriving at
the High Street he would dismount at the Swan Inn, on the
opposite side, next Swan Score (now Mariners&rsquo; Score), and
now represented by two houses, Mr. Abel&rsquo;s and Mr.
Shipley&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The Swan Inn was a very interesting old house.&nbsp; It had
been built on the foundations of a much older house, which had
one of those cellars with groined roofs already noticed, which
still remains.&nbsp; When this old house was converted into an
inn, an opening was made from the cellar into the street for beer
barrels to be let down, with brick steps, still remaining.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Trades of the Town</span>.</h4>
<p>Having given his horse into the care of the ostler, our
visitor would enter the Swan and order dinner, unless he had
dined at Beccles before starting.&nbsp; People dined at 10 and 11
o&rsquo;clock in the morning in those days.&nbsp; After dining he
would probably <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>question his host about the town, its size, character
and principal residents&mdash;its trade, population,
&amp;c.&nbsp; He would have liked much to be furnished with a
guide to Lowestoft, but there was no Mr. Arthur Stebbings or Mr.
Huke in those days to supply him with anything of the sort.&nbsp;
We, however, with the register before us, are able to gather a
great deal of the information which our ancient visitor
wanted.&nbsp; If we cannot make out a complete Directory, we can
make out a fairly complete list of the trades and occupations of
the inhabitants during our period, and of the names of many of
the persons belonging to each.</p>
<p>We find some 45 different trades or occupations mentioned as
being carried on in the town.&nbsp; The number of different
persons and families mentioned as belonging to them would,
generally speaking, vary in proportion to the number actually
engaged in each trade during the period.&nbsp; I would observe,
however, that it was not the duty of Mr. Allen and his successors
to add the trade or occupation of persons whose names he entered,
but they seem to have made a common practice of doing so, though
in an imperfect and unsystematic manner.&nbsp; In by far the
larger proportion of entries no description appears, and although
many of these entries refer to the families of persons previously
described, a great many names appear throughout our period
without any occupation being assigned to them.</p>
<p>I will first give you the number of different persons
mentioned as belonging to these different trades and
occupations.&nbsp; You will not be surprised to learn that the
most numerous class were the &ldquo;mariners,&rdquo; as they were
called in the earlier years; and afterwards &ldquo;sailor,&rdquo;
and then &ldquo;seamen.&rdquo;&nbsp; Only one person appears as a
&ldquo;fisher.&rdquo;&nbsp; This class numbered 77.&nbsp; The
next largest class you will be surprised to hear were the
tailors, of whom there were thirty-nine.&nbsp; Then came
labourers 39, butchers 20, smiths 13, carpenters, joiners, and
sawyers 12, masons 12, weavers 12, shoe makers, cordwainers, and
cobblers 11, shipwrights 10, coopers 10, millers 11, brewers 6,
<a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>bakers 4,
tanners 4, knackers 2, ropemakers 4, drapers 2, chimney sweeper
1, glovers 3, tinkers 2, carters 2, husbandmen 2, gunners 1,
neatherds 2, shearers 2, hokemaker 1, currier 1, glazier 1, dyer
1, hostler 1, fisher 1, fletcher 1, innkeeper 1, hatter 1,
ploughwright 1, wheelwright 1 and 2 towers.&nbsp; There was a
pewterer and a goldsmith, and we have 12 persons entered as
&ldquo;gentleman&rdquo; or &ldquo;gent,&rdquo; and nine persons
are described as &ldquo;merchant.&rdquo;&nbsp; Four persons are
named as &ldquo;minister&rdquo; only two of whom were ministers
of the parish.&nbsp; One person only is described as
schoolmaster&mdash;Mr. Stephen Phillip, of Annott&rsquo;s School,
and one person as a &ldquo;good school dame.&rdquo;&nbsp; One
person is described as a &ldquo;surgeon,&rdquo; and one as a
&ldquo;proctor.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lastly there are 30 names of
&ldquo;servants&rdquo; who apparently died in their
masters&rsquo; houses in the town.&nbsp; Many of these were
females, apparently domestic servants.&nbsp; The male servants
were probably employed in services connected with their
masters&rsquo; occupation.</p>
<p>Now, if we look a little closely into these lists, and combine
the information they furnish with what we can glean from other
sources, we can bring the old town very much to life again, and
in some matters should be able to tell them a good deal more
about themselves than they knew.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Vicars</span>.</h4>
<p>To commence with the Church; we find that the
&ldquo;minister&rdquo; of the parish, during the first 16 years
of our period, was Mr. Nayshe.&nbsp; He was not the Vicar.&nbsp;
The Vicar was Mr. Thomas Downing, who was also the Rector of
Besthorpe, near Attleborough, in Norfolk.&nbsp; He was allowed to
hold the Vicarage of Lowestoft (as stated in the register) to
make up for the small income of Besthorpe&mdash;a most scandalous
arrangement surely&mdash;a populous town deprived of its proper
clergyman for the sake of improving the income of the rector of a
small country parish far away in another county.&nbsp; The
arrangement, however, was made in the Roman Catholic days of
Queen Mary; three years before Queen Elisabeth had re-established
the Protestant religion in the <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>country.&nbsp; The Bishop of Norwich,
who allowed it (he did not nuke the appointment himself), was the
notorious John Hopton, described as a most sanguinary persecutor
of the Protestants.&nbsp; Witness the burning of three men at
Beccles as recorded on the tablet on the Meeting House in the
road leading from the Station to the Market Place; and of many
others in the Norwich Diocese.&nbsp; It was probably a happy
thing for Lowestoft that Bishop Hopton did not make this
appointment.&nbsp; It was said that when Elizabeth came to the
throne Bishop Hopton died from terror of her taking vengeance on
him for his cruelty to her co-religionists.&nbsp; What Mr.
Nayshe&rsquo;s views were, we know not, but he appears to have
been a good Protestant during the 13 years of his ministry under
Elizabeth.&nbsp; He must have been the first minister of the
parish for many hundred years who was a married man.&nbsp; He
lost his first wife soon after coming here, and then married,
apparently, a Lowestoft lady.&nbsp; He was succeeded in 1574, by
Mr. William Bentley, who was duly appointed vicar by the new
Bishop of Norwich, Dr. Parkhurst.&nbsp; He also married twice;
his second wife being the widow of Mr. John Arnold.&nbsp; He held
the living to the last day of our period, when he apparently fell
a victim to the terrible epidemic of that year.&nbsp; The entry
of his burial appears in the register in large
letters&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Willyam Bentlye, Pastor,&rdquo; one of
the 55 of our old townspeople who were buried in the month of
August in this year.</p>
<p>There are two other persons described as
&ldquo;ministers.&rdquo;&nbsp; They could hardly be Protestant
Nonconformists in these early days.&nbsp; The first dissenting
chapel in Lowestoft was not built till quite a hundred years
after (1695).&nbsp; These &ldquo;ministers&rdquo; out of office
were not improbably clergymen who were too much attached to the
old religion to accept appointments under the new regime.</p>
<p><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>I think
we may pay Mr. Philip, Mr. Allen&rsquo;s successor as Registrar,
the compliment of mentioning him next.&nbsp; He was not only
Parish Clerk and Registrar, but he was also &ldquo;Mr. Annott his
schoolmaster&rdquo; for 18 years during our period.&nbsp; He was
appointed by Mr. Annott himself, and held the office under the
deed of endowment after his death.&nbsp; His salary was &pound;16
a year&mdash;not a high one for a man required to teach Latin and
grammar to 40 boys, and to receive no other payment beyond twenty
pence for each new boy.&nbsp; From the entry in the register of
the burial of an old lady described as a &ldquo;good school
dame,&rdquo; we may infer that there was at least one
dame&rsquo;s school in the town besides Mr. Philip&rsquo;s
high-class academy.</p>
<p>The number of persons entered in the register as merchants and
gentlemen, and the number keeping servants, both male and female,
is evidence of there being a good proportionate number of
&ldquo;bettermost folk&rdquo; residing in our town.&nbsp;
Although probably of a less importance to the town than the
merchants and tradesmen, the fact of its being frequented by a
considerable number of persons of independent means and of a
social position to justify their being entered with the title of
&ldquo;Mr.&rdquo; or with the description of
&ldquo;gentleman,&rdquo; is very noticeable, and would seem to
imply that even in these ancient days Lowestoft had acquired some
reputation as a health resort, or as a pleasant retreat for
gentlemen of no occupation.&nbsp; We find 14 or more names of
persons of this class entered in the register&mdash;Fenn, Ruston,
Karwell, Bramton, Bright, Paine, Kene, Rowse, Fooks
(&ldquo;gentleman soldier&rdquo;) Brigge Beaching (&ldquo;a
gentleman from Sussex&rdquo;) Mason Scrasse (&ldquo;a gentleman
soldier from Sussex&rdquo;) Bentlye, Walker.&nbsp; I am inclined
to think that some of these were lodgers.&nbsp; The persons
mentioned as merchants bore the names of Mighells, Green,
Grudgefield, French, Annot, Wilde, Cooke, Burgess, and
Coldam.&nbsp; We know, however, that several other persons whose
names <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>appear without any description were engaged in business
as merchants, and occupied high positions in the town at this
period.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Fish Trade</span>.</h4>
<p>From other information it appears that several of these
merchants, if not all, were engaged in the fish trade and were
owners of fish houses, at the bottom of the cliff, still
represented by buildings occupying the same sites.</p>
<p>At a meeting of the inhabitants in the year 1596, called to
consider a proposal to take some of the rents of the Town Lands
to defray the expense incurred in litigation with Yarmouth about
the herring fishery, it was stated that out of 200 persons who
reaped advantages from this fishery, many were unable to
contribute towards the above expense, and that if the fishery was
not supported, the town would inevitably be ruined.&nbsp; It
appeared that before this meeting, the inhabitants (probably the
merchants referred to above), had already subscribed
&pound;120.&nbsp; This statement is at once evidence of the
importance of the herring trade to Lowestoft at this period, and
at the same time limits the number of merchants, fishermen, and
other persons employed in it, to 200.&nbsp; Assuming this number
mainly represented heads of families, we should have some 900
persons or about half the population of the town dependent on the
herring fishery.&nbsp; Some of these merchants doubtless owned
ships, but it appears from other information that the number of
fishing boats then belonging to Lowestoft must have been very
few, probably 20 at the outside.&nbsp; We find it stated, some
100 years after, in a petition to Charles II., that the number of
Lowestoft ships engaged in all the several voyages in the year
was 25.&nbsp; Previous to Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, Lowestoft used
to send several ships to Iceland in the spring to catch ling and
codfish.&nbsp; You have already heard that as many as 14 ships
were employed in the time of Henry VIII. in this fishery.&nbsp;
The dissolution of monasteries and the <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>neglect of the rules as to fasting,
introduced by Protestantism, appears to have affected the trade
in salted codfish very seriously, and we find it stated that in
1566 the number of Lowestoft Boats going to Iceland was reduced
from 14 to 1.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Piracy at Lowestoft</span>.</h4>
<p>The decay in the fishing trade, as regards the employment of
English ships and sailors, was not confined to Lowestoft.&nbsp;
It was felt in every English port in the West as well as on the
East Coast.&nbsp; Protestantism in the main meant progress and
commercial activity, but it did not mean this with our
fishermen.&nbsp; If eating fish on Fridays and Saturdays was
still inculcated as a duty by Elizabeth&rsquo;s Government and
Elizabeth&rsquo;s Church, the mass of the people were too
strongly Protestant to pay much respect to a rule which was an
essential feature in the old religion, if their antipathy to
Papism did not even cause an antipathy to fish eating at any
time, particularly salt cod.&nbsp; At all events, there was such
a diminution in the demand for salt fish as to throw a large
number of sailors previously engaged in fishing voyages out of
employment, and to leave this occupation almost entirely in the
hands of the French and Dutch.&nbsp; The English sailors, at
least a great many, found employment of a more exciting and
remunerative character, as privateers&mdash;in other words,
buccaneers, pirates, or sea robbers.&nbsp; Our Protestant sailors
in Elizabeth&rsquo;s time considered themselves as doing
God&rsquo;s work in robbing and scuttling any merchant ship
belonging either to France or Spain which they could come across
on the high seas; nor were they always very particular as to
either the nature or the religion of their victims.</p>
<p>You will not think that this reference to the piratical
practises of our seamen in the early part of Elizabeth&rsquo;s
reign is foreign to our subject&mdash;when I tell you that Mr.
Froude has given a story of piracy at Lowestoft in 1561, as an
illustration of its prevalence.&nbsp; He thus tells the
story:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>&ldquo;A Flemish trader has sailed from Antwerp to
Cadiz.&nbsp; Something happens to her on the way, and she never
reaches her destination.&nbsp; At midnight carts and horses run
down to the sea over the sand at Lowestoft.&nbsp; The black hull
and spars of a vessel are seen outside the breakers, dimly riding
in the gloom, and a boat shoots through the surf, loaded to the
gunwale.&nbsp; The bales and tubs are swiftly shot into the
carts.&nbsp; The horses drag back their loads, which before
daybreak are safe in the cellars of some quiet manor-house.&nbsp;
The boat sweeps off, the sails drop from the mysterious
vessel&rsquo;s yards, and she glides away in the darkness to look
for a fresh victim&rdquo;&mdash;MSS. Elizth. Vol. XVI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He gives his authority for this story, and there must have
been some foundation for it.&nbsp; I am afraid that some of the
mariners whose names appear in our register must have been on
board this black ship; but I refrain from offering any conjecture
as to which of the quiet manor-houses in our neighbourhood was
the depository of the spoil.</p>
<p>Piracy by British seamen was at this time sufficiently common
to call for the interference of Parliament.&nbsp; It exercised
much the mind of our then Prime Minister Sir William
Cecil&mdash;who held the same great office under Queen Elizabeth
that his descendant, our present Prime Minister, holds under
Queen Victoria.&nbsp; From his private memoranda on this matter
we may notice the following as directly bearing on our
subject.&nbsp; He writes&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Instead of the Iceland fleet of Englishmen,
which used to supply Normandy and Brittany, as well as England,
500 French vessels, with 30 to 40 men in each of them, go
annually to Newfoundland, and even the home fisheries have fallen
equally into the hands of strangers.&nbsp; The Yarmouth waters
(which certainly included the Lowestoft) were occupied by Flemish
and Frenchmen.&nbsp; As remedies for this evil he
mentions&mdash;(1) Merchandise, (2) Fishing, (3) <i>The exercise
of Piracy</i>, <i>which was detestable</i>, <i>and could not
last</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sufficient evidence this of the extent to which our seamen had
taken to piracy at this time.&nbsp; However detestable our Prime
Minister thought it, he did not, or could not, stop it.&nbsp; It
went on more or less throughout Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign.&nbsp;
Our sea-warriors who defeated the Spanish Armada in 1588, were
most of them the crews of these &ldquo;pirate&rdquo; ships, who
for once at least, indulged their fighting propensities in the
best service of their country.</p>
<p><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>The
only remedy at the time that Cecil could think of was an Act of
Parliament to compel people to eat fish.&nbsp; In 1562, Mr.
Froude tells us, he brought a bill into the House of Commons to
make the eating of flesh on Fridays and Saturdays a misdemeanour,
punishable by a fine of &pound;3, or three months&rsquo;
imprisonment, and, as if this was not enough, adding Wednesday as
a subsidiary or half-fish day, on which one dish of flesh might
be allowed, provided there were served at the same table and the
same meal three full competent usual dishes of sea fish of sundry
kinds, fresh and salt!&nbsp; The House of Commons, Cecil
admitted, was very much against him.&nbsp; He carried his measure
only by arguing that, if the Bill was passed, it would be almost
inoperative:&mdash;labourers and poor householders could not
observe it, and the rest by license or without license would do
as they would; while to satisfy the Puritans he was obliged to
add the ludicrous provision that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Because no person should misjudge the
intent of the statute which was politicly meant only for the
increase of fishermen and mariners, and not for any superstition
in the choice of meats, whoever should preach or teach that
eating of fish or forbearing of flesh was for the saving of the
soul of man, or for the service of God, should be punished as the
spreader of false news.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Act was passed, but it does not seem that it had more
effect than was expected in either improving the fishing trade or
in stopping piracy. <a name="citation66"></a><a
href="#footnote66" class="citation">[66]</a></p>
<p>That it was not, however, altogether a dead letter, and that
&ldquo;Cecil&rsquo;s Fast,&rdquo; as it was called, was observed
by many of the less strongly protestant of the Queen&rsquo;s
subjects, appears from the following curious old poem which was
evidently written soon after the passing of the act.&nbsp; It
shews to what a large extent fish had entered into the dietary of
a Suffolk farmer in Catholic times, and which the writer
recommends to be continued in accordance with the Law.</p>
<p><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>It was
written by Thomas Tusser, the &ldquo;Suffolk Blomfield&rdquo; of
the 16th. century.&nbsp; After being a chorister in St.
Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, and employed in some office at Court, he
retired into the country and took a farm at Cattiwade on the
Stour.&nbsp; His occupation provided him with material for his
muse, but did not improve his fortune.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Register Continued</span>.</h4>
<p>To return to our register, the 200 persons said to be
dependent on the herring fishery, in 1595, must have included a
great many of the persons entered in our list as mariners.&nbsp;
They would embrace all classes from the skipper to the
cook&mdash;sea captains like the Allens and Ashbys, and Utbers of
the next century, and fighting Jack Tars, who had <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>helped to man
the ships under Howard and Drake, when they drove the Spaniards
past Lowestoft in their flight to the north.&nbsp; Many of them
would be long-shoremen, gaining a livelihood by fishing near
shore, as now, and occasionally finding very profitable
employment in connection with the wrecks, which were far more
frequent then than now.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Other Trades Connected with the
Fisheries</span>.</h4>
<p>Besides the merchants and mariners directly engaged in the
fisheries, there were several other trades supported more or less
by the shipping business.&nbsp; There are as many as ten
different names of shipwrights in the register; showing that ship
and boat building was carried on at this time in the shipyards
under the cliff, notwithstanding the proximity of Yarmouth.&nbsp;
The six brewers probably depended largely for the sale of their
beer upon the fishing boats and other ships visiting our
roads.&nbsp; It appears that there was an enormous quantity of
beer taken on board of our fishing boats in these times; so much
that we cannot help suspecting that it was used as an inducement
to attract men on board.&nbsp; Beer was of course very cheap, not
more than a farthing and halfpenny a quart.&nbsp; From an
estimate given by some shipowners in 1670 of the quantity of beer
required for a fishing boat, it appears that each man was
supposed to drink a gallon of beer a day (putting the number of
the men at 10).&nbsp; The coopers also were evidently very
closely connected with the fishing business.&nbsp; On a later
occasion, some hundred years after our period, when Lowestoft had
had another bout with Yarmouth about the herring fishery, and the
town had a heavy lawyers bill to pay, they decided to defray the
expense by a tax on herrings, and a supplementary tax on the
brewers and coopers of the town.&nbsp; The butchers, of whom the
large number of 20 names appear in the register during our
period, probably did a good deal of business in supplying meat to
ships.&nbsp; Meat was also very cheap at this time, and was
probably eaten far more generally, and in greater quantities,
than now.&nbsp; <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>The number of bakers mentioned, 4, is very small, but
the 11 millers, though not implying that there were 11 windmills
(although probably there were nearly as many&mdash;they would be
much smaller than our present windmills) implied a large
consumption of flour.&nbsp; Lowestoft people doubtless baked at
home.&nbsp; The hokemaker, doubtless had a good trade in
supplying hooks for sea fishing, as well as for catching fish in
the &ldquo;fresh water.&rdquo;&nbsp; The tower was a man skilled
in &ldquo;hanging&rdquo; herrings in the curing-house.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Other Trades</span>.</h4>
<p>Besides these trades connected with our fishing and shipping
business, there are several others, which show that Lowestoft was
much resorted to as a shopping town by the inhabitants of the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; In these trades we must observe the enormous
number of tailors&mdash;no less than 39.&nbsp; Lowestoft tailors
probably met the requirements of the inhabitants of all the
Lothingland parishes, and other parishes near.&nbsp; Doubtless
they had got a reputation for a better cut than the tailors of
either Yarmouth or Beccles; or was a trade in ready-made clothes
carried on here?&nbsp; These men, were of course, all journeymen
tailors.&nbsp; The materials were probably supplied by some of
the merchants mentioned, from Norwich or elsewhere.&nbsp; The
persons mentioned as shoemakers, cordwainers, and cobblers (11)
are comparatively few.&nbsp; These names represented the same
trade with different pretensions.&nbsp; The presence of a tanner
and currier implies that their was a sufficient demand for
leather to maintain these two wholesale trades.&nbsp; The tanners
may have also found employment in tanning fishing nets&mdash;as
at the present day.&nbsp; No less than 12 weavers are mentioned;
they were probably introduced from Norwich, which was at this
time the principal seat of the woollen and linen manufacture in
the kingdom.&nbsp; The clothes of some at least of our
townspeople were not only made up by Lowestoft tailors, but of
Lowestoft cloth and Lowestoft homespun.&nbsp; Other trades are
mentioned connected with the supply of wearing apparel, viz.:
drapers, glovers, hatters, and dyers.</p>
<p><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>The
building and mechanical trades are represented by the carpenters,
joiners, and sawyers, the masons (bricklayers were not
distinguished from masons as yet), the smiths, the
plough-wrights, and the wheelwrights.&nbsp; These tradesmen
probably all found employment among the farmers and squires in
the neighbourhood as well as in the town&mdash;as also the
&ldquo;knackers&rdquo; (or harness makers)&mdash;the
tinkers&mdash;and the thatchers (&ldquo;thacsters&rdquo; as it
was spelt).&nbsp; The houses both in town and country and nearly
all our churches were thatched at this time, and reeds were
abundant on the side of Lake Lothing.</p>
<p>The presence in our town at this time of two such trades as
the goldsmith and the pewterer is very noticeable.&nbsp; The
goldsmith was at this time the prince of tradesmen, soon to
develop into the banker of after times.&nbsp; His presence
certainly implied the existence of several persons in the town or
immediate neighbourhood of sufficient means to be the purchasers
of gold and silver ornaments, while the presence of the pewterer
implied that our town was up to date in the matter of table
furniture, and that pewter plates and goblets had been
substituted in many of our houses for the wooden trenchers and
horn drinking cups of older times. <a name="citation70"></a><a
href="#footnote70" class="citation">[70]</a></p>
<p>The fletcher&mdash;or maker of bows and
arrows&mdash;represented a trade soon to become obsolete, except
for supplying bows and arrows for the sport of archery, which was
very much in fashion at this time and took the place of cricket
and football matches of our day.&nbsp; Pistols and arquebuses
were already in use as firearms for military purposes, and
fowling-pieces were beginning to be used by sportsmen, who could
afford to buy them.&nbsp; We have evidence of their having
already reached Lowestoft in the entry of a burial of a person
who &ldquo;met his death with a gun.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bows and
arrows, were, however, not altogether discarded for military
purposes.&nbsp; In 1569.&nbsp; Elizabeth sent an order to
Yarmouth to provide 50 bows <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>and 50 sheaves of arrows, amongst
other preparations to be made against the coming war with Spain,
or France, or both together, with which England was threatened
all through Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign; and in the reports to the
Government of the piratical proceedings of our sea hawks (which
we have spoken of before) we hear of a case where they attacked
their quarry, not only &ldquo;by shooting of cannon at them, but
by firing at them flights of innumerable arrows.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Bows and arrows were probably still to be found in the houses of
farmers and peasants in Lothingland, to be used for sporting as
well as fighting purposes.&nbsp; The Queen herself was very fond
of hunting, and often shot small deer with the long bow, as well
as with the arblast or crossbow.</p>
<p>The person described as a Proctor must have been a local
lawyer, affiliated to Doctors&rsquo; Commons, and endowed with
some special authority in the matter of wills.&nbsp; Only one
person&rsquo;s name appears in our period described as a
surgeon.&nbsp; He died in 1585, one of those terrible years when
Lowestoft was visited by the plague or some infectious disease,
to which he apparently fell a victim.&nbsp; We only notice the
name of one chymney-sweeper.&nbsp; There may have been
more.&nbsp; But as we shall see further on, chimneys were only
now coming into fashion and were as yet only to be found in the
newer or best houses.</p>
<p>This sketch, imperfect as it is, of the trades and occupations
of the inhabitants of our town, will, I think, leave no doubt in
your minds that Lowestoft was at this time a very respectable
little town&mdash;well represented by residents of every grade in
the social scale&mdash;and frequented by the inhabitants of
Lothingland, and the adjoining parishes in the south, for
shopping and business purposes.&nbsp; Indeed, that the
neighbourhood was more dependent on Lowestoft for shopping
purposes than now, we can understand, when we bear in mind the
absence or extreme badness of the roads, which rendered
communication with any town beyond Beccles difficult and
expensive.&nbsp; Yarmouth was not far off; <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>but Yarmouth
although richer and more populous, could not afford counter
attractions to Lowestoft as a shopping town, at all events for
the residents on the Suffolk side of the water.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Lowestoft as a Market Town</span>.</h4>
<p>Lowestoft had been a market town for more than a hundred
years, but it does not appear that the market was ever much of a
success.&nbsp; There was no large population like that of
Yarmouth requiring a large supply of provisions and vegetables in
addition to the produce of the townspeople&rsquo;s own gardens
and the neighbouring farms.&nbsp; Nor could a place with only
half the environment of an ordinary inland town be a convenient
centre for the sale of general agricultural produce, particularly
with another large market at Beccles.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Population</span>.</h4>
<p>While furnishing information as to the character of the town,
the register supplies us with trustworthy evidence of its size
and population in Elizabeth&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; A comparison of
the numbers of marriages, christenings, and burials for the two
periods of 21 years comprising our period, shows no evidence of
increase during Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, while a comparison of
the entries in this period with the corresponding entries for the
21 years, 1754&ndash;1774, shows that there was no material
increase in the population after a lapse of some 200 years.</p>

<p>We know from actual survey that in 1775 the population was
2,235, and the number houses 445.&nbsp; This population, compared
with the number of burials shown above, gives a death-rate of 21
per 1,000.&nbsp; The mortality in Elizabeth&rsquo;s time was
probably much higher.&nbsp; Putting it at 26 per 1,000, <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>the average
number of burials stated above would represent a population of
about 1,800.&nbsp; I think we may regard this number as a safe
estimate of the population of our town during Elizabeth&rsquo;s
time, and that the number of houses would be about 360.&nbsp; In
1801 the population was 2,332, and I am inclined to think that
there was very little difference in the size and character of our
town in the 16th century compared with what it was at the
beginning of the present century.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Dutch Refugees</span>.</h4>
<p>We cannot pass from this part of our subject without noticing
an interesting episode in the history of the town which belongs
to this period.&nbsp; About the year 1571 the resident population
of Lowestoft was temporarily enlarged by the hospitable reception
of a number of &ldquo;Dutch Folk,&rdquo; as they are called in
the register.&nbsp; These were refugees from the Low Countries,
who sought shelter in this country, at the invitation of
Elizabeth, from the ruthless persecution of the Duke of
Alva.&nbsp; Thousands of these Protestant refugees were admitted
into English towns&mdash;some 4,000 into Norwich.&nbsp; Swinden
gives us a copy of a letter of Elizabeth written in 1568 to
Yarmouth, asking them to admit 30 Dutch families to the
privileges of their town.&nbsp; Whether a similar letter was
written to Lowestoft we know not, but it is evident from the
register that quite as large a number as this must have found
asylum here, and made it their home for some three or four
years.&nbsp; Marriages, christenings, and burials of &ldquo;Dutch
Folk&rdquo; appear frequently in the register during these years,
and the fact that among the burials for one year (1573) no less
than 10 Dutch names appear, shews that there were a considerable
number then living here.&nbsp; Among the names are some that seem
to belong to families of rank.&nbsp; They left about the year
1574, when Alva had been recalled; and when the terror of his
executions had been replaced by a patriotic eagerness to take
part in the war which was soon to result in the Freedom of the
Netherlands.</p>
<p><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>The
following account of the home comforts enjoyed by the less
wealthy of our ancestors in the early part of the 16th century,
as compared with the incipient luxury of the Elizabethan age, is
given us by the author of the &ldquo;Chronicles of
Holinshed,&rdquo; who lived during this period.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Neither do I speak this in reproach of any
man, God is my judge; but to show that I do rejoice rather to see
how God has blessed us with His good gifts, and to behold how
that in a time wherein all things <i>are grown to most excessive
prices</i> we do yet find the means to obtain and achieve such
<i>furniture</i> as has been heretofore impossible.&nbsp; There
are old men yet dwelling in the village where I remain which have
noted three things to be marvellously altered in England within
<i>their sound remembrance</i>.&nbsp; One is the multitude of
<i>chimnies lately</i> erected; whereas in their young days there
were not above two or three, if so many, in most <i>uplandish</i>
towns <i>of the realm</i> (the religious houses and manor places
of their lords always excepted and peradventure of some great
personage), but each made his fire against a reredos in the hall
where he dined and dressed his meat.&nbsp; The second is, the
great amendment of lodging, for, said they, our fathers and we
ourselves have lain full oft upon straw pallets covered only with
a sheet, under coverlets made of dogswaine or hop harlots (I use
their own terms) and a good round log under their heads instead
of a bolster.&nbsp; If it were so, that the father or good man of
the house, had a mattress or flock bed, and thereto a sack of
chaff to rest his head upon, he thought himself to be as well
lodged as the lord of the town, so well were they
contented.&nbsp; Pillows said they, were thought meet only for
women in child bed.&nbsp; As for servants, if they had any sheet
above them it was well, for seldom had they any under their
bodies to keep them from the pricking straws that ran oft through
the canvass, and rased their hardened hides.&nbsp; The third
thing they tell of, is the exchange of treene platters (so called
I suppose from tree or wood) into pewter, and wooden spoons into
silver or tin.&nbsp; For so common were all sorts of treene
vessels in old times, that a man should hardly find four pieces
of pewter (of which one peradventure a salt) in a good
farmer&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chapter XVI.&nbsp; &ldquo;In times past men were contented to
dwell in houses built of sallow, willow &amp;c., so that the use
of the oak was in a manner dedicated wholly unto churches,
religious houses, princes&rsquo; palaces, navigation, &amp;c.,
but now sallow &amp;c., is rejected, and nothing but oak any
where regarded and yet see the change, for when our houses were
builded of willow then had we oaken men, but now that our houses
are come to be made of oak, our men are not only become willow,
but a great many altogether of straw, which is a great
alteration.&nbsp; Now have we many chimnies and yet our
tenderlings complain of rheums, catarrhs and poses; then had we
none but reredosses and our heads did never ache.&nbsp; For as
the smoke in those days was supposed to be a sufficient hardning
of the timber of the house, so it was reputed a far better

<p>The remains of ancient houses or other buildings which have
survived the process of rebuilding in our town are very few, but
there is one house at least, representing the houses of
Elizabeth&rsquo;s time which retains very much of its original
character.&nbsp; This is the house known as the &ldquo;South
Flint House,&rdquo; at the top of Wilde&rsquo;s score which bears
the initials W. M. and the date 1586 over the front door.&nbsp;
The front of this house is built of square flints, much more
expensive work than the alternate layers of cobbles and bricks
with which the other walls were made.&nbsp; The ground floor
appears to have originally consisted of one large room, with a
fireplace and chimney in the centre, corresponding with that
described by Holinshed as the hall where the
&ldquo;good-man&rdquo; dined and dressed his meat (except that
the fire was not against a &ldquo;reredos&rdquo; at the side
wall).&nbsp; The two rooms above this are evidently much the same
as they were at first, having each a stone fireplace with W.
M.&nbsp; The house has been enlarged since with the addition of a
wing.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Part</span> II.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Lowestoft and Yarmouth at the End of the 16th
Century</span>.</h3>
<p>Two hundred years had passed since the termination of the
Parliamentary contest about the grant of Edward the III&rsquo;s.
Charter.&nbsp; Lowestoft had not only established her right to
exist, but was becoming an old town, and the events of the old
contest had become matters of ancient history.</p>
<p><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>The
Yarmouth bailiffs were still exercising their right to take tolls
from ships loading or unloading in &ldquo;Kirkley Road;&rdquo;
but the amount received from these tolls during a whole year, as
entered in the Town Ledger, was very small, varying from a few
pounds in one year to a few shillings in another.&nbsp; It seems
that this demand had been confined to vessels trading in general
merchandise, apart altogether from the claim to take tolls from
fishing boats anchored off Lowestoft.</p>
<p>During these two hundred years Yarmouth had retained and even
increased her trade, and had recovered her population, though her
progress had been much retarded by the persistent action of the
sea in blocking up her harbour.</p>
<p>The very existence of Yarmouth depended on her harbour.&nbsp;
Her anomalous privilege of taking tolls from ships anchored in
the North Sea could be no substitute for a harbour.&nbsp; This
she knew well, and within two years of her obtaining her Charter,
on the ground that her harbour was blocked up, she commenced
opening another mouth.</p>
<p>Between 1393 and 1565 she had five times strained her
resources to meet the expense of making new mouths, all of which
had been blocked up; some almost immediately; one had been kept
open for several years, but not without a constant expenditure of
money and labour.&nbsp; At length in 1565 she undertook for the
seventh time the work of making a new mouth.&nbsp; On this
occasion, the assistance of a Dutch engineer was obtained, who
knew how these things were done in Holland.&nbsp; Under his
advice and superintendance a mouth was constructed, fortified by
piles and stonework, and involving a much larger outlay than any
of the previous works.&nbsp; The relief from taxes, and the
reduction of her fee farm rent, which every King had granted from
Richard II. to Elizabeth, was supplemented by special grants to
assist the town in this undertaking.&nbsp; After some years of
persevering effort, the work was completed and the existing
Gorleston harbour was made.&nbsp; Ships could now freely enter
her harbour and bring their cargos to the <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>&ldquo;Crane
Key.&rdquo;&nbsp; A revival of her trade followed, and the wealth
of her merchants rapidly increased.&nbsp; It was now that those
houses were built along the Quay, the remains of many of which
still survive to shew the grandeur of their original
structure.&nbsp; One of the finest of these old houses is the
venerable Star Hotel in which the room, called Nelson&rsquo;s
room, retains its original character:&mdash;its richly carved oak
pannelling, embossed ceiling, and large stone fireplace.&nbsp;
But while her trade in general merchandise and in fish curing had
increased, there had been no proportionate revival of her old
fishing fleet.&nbsp; When Elizabeth was calling upon her subjects
to supply ships to fight against the Spanish Armada, Yarmouth was
joined with Lowestoft in a demand for one ship and one
pinnace.&nbsp; The ship supplied was the
&ldquo;<i>Grace</i>&rdquo; of Yarmouth, of 120 tons, and carrying
70 men.&nbsp; The &ldquo;pinnace&rdquo; was supplied by Lowestoft
at the cost of &pound;100.&nbsp; Such a contribution from
Yarmouth was very different to that of the 43 ships and 1075
sailors, with which she supplied Edward the III. at the siege of
Calais.</p>
<p>Meanwhile with the assistance of the Dutch and French
fishermen the Free Fair at Yarmouth was going on as merrily as
ever, and the Barons of the Cinque Ports still paid their annual
visit to take part in its management.&nbsp; Even in the Armada
year their visit was not withheld, as appears from the following
amusing account of the termination of their journey, when coming
to Yarmouth in the autumn of that year.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The next day after we had dined at
Layestoff, we took horse, and proceeded on the rest of our
journey, and drawing towards Yarmouth Bridge, there attended our
coming divers sorts of poor, lame and distressed people, who
cried out for some relief, on whom we bestowed some pieces of
money, and so riding over the Bridge about 2 o&rsquo;clock in the
afternoon we arrived sooner than our coming was expected.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding there gathered and flocked together a great store
of people, who very friendly bade us welcome; to whom we gave
thanks and passed forward unto the town along the Quay, and there
took our lodging, which had been provided for us at one Mr.
Dameth&rsquo;s house, where we were very courteously
entertained.&rdquo; <a name="citation77"></a><a
href="#footnote77" class="citation">[77]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>At this
time the Yarmouth bailiffs were possessed of an admiralty
jurisdiction, with special powers for taking cognizance of
offences committed in &ldquo;Kirkley Road&rdquo; or as it was now
called &ldquo;Lestoff Road&rdquo; (as spelt in the town ledger of
the period).&nbsp; At this time moreover (about 1595) the mouth
of the harbour was in a better condition than it ever had been,
and the Yarmouth fish merchants had no longer any need to
transgress the Statute of Herrings themselves by unloading their
fish outside the harbour.&nbsp; It was under these circumstances
that the Bailiffs determined to attempt a revival of the almost
obsolete provisions of their ancient charter which prohibited the
buying of Herrings in Kirkley Road.</p>
<p>It appears that for some years previously fish merchants from
other towns in the Eastern counties had been in the habit of
visiting these roads in the autumn season and filling their
&ldquo;Ketches&rdquo; with herrings from the foreign fishing
boats.&nbsp; It was against these men that the Yarmouth bailiffs
now directed their attacks.</p>
<p>We hear of their proceedings from &ldquo;The Complaint of the
Ketchmen against Yarmouth&rdquo; submitted to the Privy Council
in 1595, signed by the bailiffs and inhabitants of Ipswich,
Southwold, Manningtree, Dunwich, Colchester, and Aldborough.</p>
<p>It appears that the Yarmouth Bailiffs had not only sent their
officers into the roads off Lowestoft to require the foreign
fishermen to carry their fish into Yarmouth, but that they had
taken active measures against the buyers, and had carried off
&ldquo;seven men&rsquo;s goods which they have brought thither to
be sold and have committed the owners thereof to prison and
constrained them to buy their goods again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lowestoft merchants were also warned to discontinue the
illegal practice of buying fish in Kirkley Road.&nbsp; They at
once joined in the petition of the Ketchman to the Privy Council,
and a suit against Yarmouth was commenced in the Court of the
Star chamber.&nbsp; The managers of the <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>Lowestoft
case retained the services of Mr. Counsellor Bacon, then a rising
barrister, afterwards the great Lord Bacon.&nbsp; In conjunction
with two senior counsel he gave the following very decided
opinion in favour of Lowestoft;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That by the statutes and charters aforesaid
any man may sell or buy herrings in the road called Kirkley Road,
without the lawful let or hindrance of the town of Yarmouth; and
if any proclamation be made by the said men of Yarmouth, or any
other of the subjects of this realm to the contrary, the same, in
our opinion, is unlawful, whether it be within or without this
time of the Fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Chas. Drew; Ja. Bargrave; Fr.
Bacon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The case was referred by the Star Chamber to the judges for
their opinion on the questions of law involved.&nbsp; They at
once cut the knot by deciding that the old statutes and charters
were still in force, but that the &ldquo;7 leuks&rdquo; mentioned
in them, could only mean 7 miles; the measure recently
established by statute, and the only legal measure which the word
&ldquo;leuca&rdquo; could then mean.&nbsp; Such a decision would
at once settle the appeal in favour of Lowestoft.&nbsp; The Star
Chamber however refused to accept this interpretation, and sent
the case back to the Judges.&nbsp; The Judges adhered to their
construction of the word &ldquo;leuca,&rdquo; but advised that
question should be referred to Parliament for settlement.&nbsp;
The decision of the Judges was convenient, but in holding that
the word &ldquo;leuca&rdquo; in the old charters meant a
&ldquo;mile&rdquo; as determined by the recent statute, they
clearly ignored the whole purport and intention of the enactment
against which Lowestoft had fought in the Parliaments of Edward
and Richard.&nbsp; A Bill appears to have been prepared to be
introduced into the following Session (1597) for giving
Parliamentary sanction to this construction, and ordering that
the distance of 7 miles should be measured along the shore from
Yarmouth towards Lowestoft, and that a mark should be set up at
the end of that distance.&nbsp; This Bill, although set out by
Gillingwater, does not appear to have been passed.&nbsp; The
result however, of these proceedings was that in pursuance of the
advice of the judges, the distance was measured, and a pole set
up at the end of the 7 miles <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>on Gunton Denes.&nbsp; Although
recognised by Lowestoft men as marking the boundary beyond which
they might not land herrings, it was ignored altogether by
Yarmouth; as it had not been placed in pursuance of any legal
order.&nbsp; The Yarmouth bailiffs however abstained from any
further assertion of their claims at this time, and the Lowestoft
merchants and the Suffolk Ketchmen continued to carry on their
dealings with the fishing boats in the Roads as before.</p>
<p>Why the Act of Parliament, advised by the judges, was not
introduced, or, if introduced, was not passed, we are not
told.&nbsp; Probably the influence of Yarmouth in the House of
Commons was very different at this time from what it was when the
&ldquo;Commons&rdquo; supported Lowestoft against the Crown in
the times of Edward and Richard.</p>
<p>The death of Elizabeth, and the succession of James I., gave
Yarmouth an opportunity to procure a new charter from the Crown,
which contained provisions for removing the doubts that had been
raised as to the whereabouts and extent of Kirkley Road.</p>
<p>It contained a new grant of Kirkley Road, and actually revived
the obsolete &ldquo;leuca,&rdquo; as a measure of 2 miles, so as
to make the new grant include &ldquo;Lestoff&rdquo; Road, and the
whole stretch of Roads, &ldquo;from Winterton Ness to Easton
Ness, containing in length 14 leuks or thereabouts, and in
breadth into the sea 7 leuks from every part of the shore within
those places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For this charter they undertook to pay the Crown an additional
rent of &pound;5 per annum. <a name="citation80"></a><a
href="#footnote80" class="citation">[80]</a>&nbsp; Having thus
repaired their armour they waited for a convenient occasion to
renew the contest.&nbsp; But some 50 years or more were to pass,
and another war was to be waged, before Yarmouth&rsquo;s
opportunity arrived for testing the strength of her new
weapon.</p>

81</span>LECTURE IV.</h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">Part</span> I.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">In the Time of Charles</span> I.</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the 17th century the decay of our
fisheries, and the consequent loss of sailors, on whose services
the country depended for the protection of our shores, coupled
with the warning which the Spaniards had given us, had caused a
sense of national danger, which was realised by many besides
ministers of the Crown.&nbsp; During his imprisonment of 13 years
in the Tower of London, poor Sir Walter Raleigh wrote a pamphlet,
which he presented to James I., in which he complained bitterly
of our shame in allowing the Dutch and the French to get the
command of our home fisheries.&nbsp; He says that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;While the English were sending their ships
into the North Seas to catch whales, the Dutch were catching the
herrings and codfish in our own seas; that in 1603 the Dutch
fishermen sold &pound;1,759,000 worth of herrings, and employed
2,000 busses and 50,000 men.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Among other pamphlets written to rouse the nation and the
government to take active measures for curing this evil, a
powerful appeal appeared from an anonymous writer, entitled
&ldquo;England&rsquo;s way to win wealth and to employ ships and
manners.&nbsp; By Tobias, Gentleman, Fisherman and
Mariner,&rdquo; dated 1614.&nbsp; Speaking of the Dutch
fishermen, he says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Also to Yarmouth do they daily (i.e. during
the season), come into the haven up to the Key, all the most part
of the great fleet of Hollanders, that go in sword-pinks, Holland
toads, crab skuits, walnut shells, and great and small yeurs, 100
and 200 sail at a time together, and all the herrings they do
bring they sell for ready money to Yarmouth men; and also the
Frenchmen of Picardy and Normandy some hundred sail of them at a
time, do come hither, and all the herrings they catch they do
sell to the Yarmouth herring-mongers for ready gold.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>The
writer gives the following account of the fisheries carried on by
the Yarmouth merchants in their own boats.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To this town belong some 20 Iceland Barks,
which they do send for cod and ling, and some 150 sail of North
Sea boats.&nbsp; They make a shift to live; but if they had the
use of busses and also barrel fish they would excel all England
and Holland; for they be the only fishermen for the North Seas,
and also the best for the handling of fish that are in this
land.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also gives an account of the trade as carried on at
Lowestoft at this time, which you will be surprised to hear
spoken of as a &ldquo;decayed town.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To the north of Swold Haven (Southwold),
three leagues are Kirkley and Layestof, decayed towns.&nbsp; They
have 6 or 7 North Sea boats; but they of Layestof make benefit
yearly of buying herrings of the Hollanders; for likewise these
Hollanders are hosted with the Layestof men, as they are with the
Yarmouthians.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The government of Elizabeth had adopted various measures (with
one of which you are already well acquainted) for encouraging the
employment of English ships and sailors in the fishing trade, and
the general commerce of the country.&nbsp; But the English could
not successfully compete with the Dutch fishermen even off our
own shores.&nbsp; Charles took stronger measures to get these
fisheries into the hands of Englishmen.&nbsp; He determined to
issue a prohibition against the subjects of foreign countries
fishing in what he claimed to be British seas, without a license
from the English government.&nbsp; In order to be able to enforce
such an offensive measure he took steps for providing a more
powerful navy than the country had ever before possessed.&nbsp;
Unfortunately he had already quarreled with his Parliament, and
he had to obtain the money required by demands authorised only by
his Royal Prerogative.&nbsp; However popular the measure would
have been, if it had been carried out by constitutional means,
the imposition upon the whole country, without the consent of
Parliament, of the tax called &ldquo;ship money,&rdquo; was the
fatal proceeding which brought on the Civil War.&nbsp; He
succeeded however at first, and at once issued his prohibition
which the Dutch refused to submit to, and in 1536, Hume tells
us&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>&ldquo;A formidable fleet of 60 sail, the greatest that
England had ever known, was equipped under the Earl of
Northumberland who had orders to attack the Herring busses of the
Dutch which fished in what was called the British
seas.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The effect of this attack upon the Dutch and French fishing in
what was called the British seas was felt by Yarmouth and
Lowestoft immediately.&nbsp; No more could their merchants rely
upon their foreign visitors for their supply of herrings.&nbsp;
If they were to retain their trade in herrings they must now
catch them themselves or have their supplies limited to the
produce of the English fishermen from southern ports.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Lowestoft in The Civil War</span>.</h4>
<p>Both towns had submitted, with the other maritime towns of
Norfolk and Suffolk to the demands for ship money with which this
fleet had been provided, but when the demand for more ships and
more money was made in the following years, the loyalty of both
towns must have been sorely tried.</p>
<p>The events which followed upon the King&rsquo;s renewal of his
demand for ship-money throughout the kingdom, form the saddest
chapters in the history of our country.&nbsp; We have only to
notice those in which our two towns were concerned.</p>
<p>The Long Parliament met in 1640, and in 1642 Yarmouth declared
herself for &ldquo;the King and Parliament,&rdquo; which meant
that she was prepared to side with the Parliament against the
King.&nbsp; Lowestoft took a different course.&nbsp; Although
probably, like most other towns, and even families, at this
terrible and critical period, our old townspeople were divided on
the grave questions at issue, it appears that several of the
leading persons in the town were so much inclined to the
King&rsquo;s side, that instead of at once joining the East
Anglian Association with the rest of the towns and parishes, and
most of the landed gentry in the county, they entered into
communication with some of the Cavalier party and offered
Lowestoft as a rendezvous for the King&rsquo;s friends.&nbsp;
Such a course was perhaps only a natural sequel to the steps <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>taken a few
years before in applying to the King to exempt the town from
contributing to the expenses of the county members, on the ground
of being Ancient Demesne of the Crown.&nbsp; In the return of Sir
Nathaniel Barnardiston and Sir Philip Parker, the Roundhead
members for Suffolk, in the Long Parliament, Lowestoft had no
part.</p>
<p>We have unfortunately no local records of the measures taken
by our old townspeople, or by their cavalier visitors for
converting the little town into a royalist stronghold; but it
appears that in the early part of the year 1643, while Cromwell
was at Cambridge, busy in establishing there the Head quarters of
the East Anglian Association, he received information of &ldquo;a
great confederacy among the malignants of a town called
Lowestoft, being a place of great consequence.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
said that the information was given him by a man who brought fish
to Cambridge; doubtless a Yarmouth man.&nbsp; Cromwell, with his
usual energy, started off at once to nip this
&ldquo;malignant&rdquo; movement in the bud.</p>
<p>We have a full account of what took place from a letter
written at the time by Mr. J. Cory, a Norwich man.&nbsp; Cromwell
started with 5 troops of horse, which he increased at Norwich,
with 80 volunteer dragoons, under Captain Fountain and Captain
Rich, and arranged with the Yarmouth people to meet him at
Lowestoft with an additional force of foot volunteers and 5
pieces of ordnance.&nbsp; With this formidable force he appeared
at Lowestoft on the March.&nbsp; He found</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That the town had blocked themselves up,
all except where they had placed their ordnance, which were three
pieces, before which a chain was drawn to keep off the
horse.&nbsp; The Colonel surrounded the town and demanded that
they should give up the strangers, the town, and their army,
promising them their favour, if so; if not, none.&nbsp; They
yielded to deliver their strangers, but not the rest.&nbsp; Where
upon our Norwich dragoons crept under the chain before mentioned,
and came within pistol shot of the ordnance, preparing to fire
upon their cannoneer, who fled.&nbsp; So they gained the two
pieces of ordnance and broke the chain, and they and the horses
entered the town without resistance; when presently eighteen
strangers yielded themselves&mdash;Sir T. Barker, Sir John
Pettus, of Norfolk, Mr. Knivett, of Ashwell Thorpe, Mr. Richard
Catelyn&rsquo;s son, some say his father too was there in the <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>morning.&nbsp; Sir F. Cory, my unfortunate cousin, who I
wish could have been better persuaded, Mr. Brooke, the sometime
minister of Yarmouth, and some others escaped over the
river.&nbsp; There was good stores of pistols and other arms; I
bear above 50 cases of pistols.&nbsp; The Colonel stayed there
Tuesday and Wednesday night.&nbsp; On Friday night the Colonel
brought in hither (Norwich), his prisoners taken at Lowestoft and
Mr. Trott of Beccles.&nbsp; On Saturday night, with one troop, he
sent all the prisoners to Cambridge.&nbsp; Sir John Wentworth (of
Somerleyton), has come off with the payment of
&pound;1000.&rdquo; <a name="citation85"></a><a
href="#footnote85" class="citation">[85]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have a short account of these proceedings from the other
side, from no less a personage than the Vicar himself, Mr. Jacob
Rous, who had evidently taken an active part in the
movement.&nbsp; He has left in the Parish Register, this note,
dated 1646.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Reader, whoever thou art, that shall have
occasion to use this booke, know that by this means for these two
following years it comes to be soe imperfect as thou
find&rsquo;st it.&nbsp; On the 14th March, 1643, Colonel
Cromwell, with a brigade of horse and certain foote, which he had
from Yarmouth, came to this towne and from thence carried away
prisoners.&nbsp; Sir Thomas Barker and his brother, Sir John
Pettis, Mr. Knivett, of Ashwell Thorpe, Mr. Catlin, Captain
Hammond, Mr. Thomas Cory, with others to Cambridge, and with
them, myself, Mr. Thomas Allen, Mr. Simon Canham and Thomas
Canham, of this towne, so that for some time following, there was
in this town neither minister nor clerke, but the inhabitants
weare enforced to procure now one and then another to baptize
their children, by which means there was no register kept, only
those few hearafter mentioned wear by myselfe baptised in those
intervalls when I enjoied my freedom.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have in these extracts, I believe, the only original
records of this exciting episode in the history of our old
town.&nbsp; What became of the &ldquo;army,&rdquo; which Cromwell
had been led to suppose he would find at Lowestoft we are not
informed.&nbsp; The accounts give the impression that the
inhabitants of Lowestoft had taken very little part in the
movement, and that the preparations were the work of the
influential &ldquo;strangers,&rdquo; with the concurrence of the
Vicar, the Parish Clerk, and a few other leading men.&nbsp; Mr.
Mighells, one of the leading merchants of the time, had the
credit of saving the little town from the fate in which the
gallant cavaliers would have involved it, by appearing on the
scene and dissuading resistance to Cromwell&rsquo;s
entrance.&nbsp; <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>After a stay of two nights at the Swan, and the capture
of the &ldquo;strangers&rdquo; and the few
&ldquo;malignants&rdquo; among the townspeople, Cromwell returned
to Cambridge with his troop and left the little town in peace,
without considering it necessary to leave any force to insure its
future allegiance to the Parliamentary cause.</p>
<p>The story of this incident has naturally been considerably
improved.&nbsp; In a petition to the judges, drawn up some 20
years afterwards, the proceedings of Cromwell and his soldiers
were represented as &ldquo;taking and plundering the town,
imprisoning many of their principal inhabitants, and causing
others to fly beyond the sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; The plundering seems
to have been confined to the quartering of the soldiers for two
nights without payment.&nbsp; Tradition only tells of one case,
illustrative of any other plundering, viz.: that of the
blacksmith, Frarey, who Mr. Suckling tells us&mdash;&ldquo;was
completely stripped of all his goods and obliged to keep his
horse in the parlour of his house to prevent it being carried off
by the soldiers.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;stripping of all his
goods by the soldiers&rdquo; consisted probably in their using
his iron and tools to shoe their horses, without payment.&nbsp;
Why, if bent on further plunder they did not take the trouble of
looking into his parlour, the story does not explain.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;many of the principal inhabitants taken prisoners&rdquo;
were the four persons mentioned by Mr. Rouse.&nbsp; The others
who &ldquo;had to fly beyond the sea&rdquo; were apparently a few
of our sea warriors who had served in the King&rsquo;s navy, and
who took advantage of the civil war to start a career of
privateering from a Dutch port.&nbsp; We shall hear of their
proceedings shortly.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Hostilities between Yarmouth and
Lowestoft</span>.</h4>
<p>In 1642 the Yarmouth men had the luck to capture a ship sent
over by the Queen with arms and ammunition for the King&rsquo;s
army.&nbsp; After confiscating this ship in their Admiralty
Court, with the approval of the Parliament, they <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>fitted it out
as a man of war, and in 1644 sent it out as a privateer on the
side of the Parliament.&nbsp; They commenced hostilities by
capturing a &ldquo;pink&rdquo; lying in the harbour, of which
&lsquo;Captain Allen&rsquo; was part owner.&nbsp; This was Mr.
Thomas Allen of Lowestoft, who was then one of Cromwell&rsquo;s
prisoners at Cambridge, afterwards Admiral Allen and Sir Thomas
Allen of Somerleyton.&nbsp; He had gone over to Yarmouth the day
before Cromwell&rsquo;s visit to change dollars, and it appears
that he was captured by some Yarmouth men and handed over to
Cromwell.&nbsp; He was released after about two years detention,
and in 1645 we find him engaged in active warfare for the King
against Yarmouth.&nbsp; The Yarmouth men confined their claim
against the pink to Captain Allen&rsquo;s share, which they sold
to Mr. James Wylde, another Lowestoft man, but not a
&lsquo;malignant,&rsquo; for &pound;35.&nbsp; We are told by Mr.
Swinden that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Inhabitants of Yarmouth had already
suffered very much by losses at sea, their ships, vessels, and
goods being frequently taken and carried away by &ldquo;rovers
and pirates&rdquo; at sea, and others in hostility against the
Parliament, whereby the town was greatly impoverished.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Out of the 23 Yarmouth ships sent to catch cod in Iceland in
1644, 20 were sunk by the &ldquo;pirates.&rdquo;&nbsp; To protect
their fishermen, Yarmouth, in 1645, obtained three men of war
from the Parliament.&nbsp; These ships captured several of the
pirate ships, among the crew of which they found several
Lowestoft men.&nbsp; These captures brought a letter from Ostend
signed by Captain Allen and 11 other Englishmen, including two or
three more Lowestoft names, threatening Yarmouth with reprisals
if these men were not liberated.&nbsp; The hostilities carried on
by these &ldquo;Ostend pirates&rdquo; against the Yarmouth
fishing boats could not have much advanced the cause of the
King.&nbsp; We do not, however, hear of any lives being taken in
the encounters, but the loss inflicted upon the Yarmouth and
other fishermen must have been very severe, if the following
statement in Captain Allen&rsquo;s letter was anything more than
bluster.</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>&ldquo;Have we given you thousands of prisoners which we
might have indungeoned, nay hanged, but that rebellious ignorance
impleaded their escape.&nbsp; Now we can if you compel us make a
hundred suffer for one.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><span class="smcap">Removal of Memorial Brasses from the
Church</span>.</h4>
<p>In 1644 our church suffered some illusage from the Protestant
fervour of the Parliament.&nbsp; The story, as told by the Vicar,
Mr. Jacob Rouse, is as follows&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the same year after, on the 22nd of
June, there came one Jessope with a commission from the Earl of
Manchester to take away from gravestones all inscriptions on
which he found &ldquo;orate pro anima;&rdquo;&nbsp; A wretched
commissioner not able to read or find out that which his
commission informed him to remove, hee took up in our church so
much brasses as he sould to Mr. Josiah Wild for five shillings,
which was afterwards contrary to my knowledge, run into the litle
bell that hangs in the town house.&nbsp; Thear wearr taken up in
the middle ally, twelve peeces, belonging to the twelve severall
generations of the Jettors; in the chancell, one belonging to
Bishop Scroope; the words were &ldquo;Richardus Scroope Episcopus
Dromorocensis et hujus ecclesi&aelig; vicarius, hic jacet, qui
obiit 10 may anno 1364.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was also by this
Jessop taken up in the vicar&rsquo;s chancell, one the north side
of the church, a fair peece of brasse with this inscription
&ldquo;Hic jacet Johannes Goodknapp hujus ecclesi&aelig; vicarius
qui obiit 4 Decembris anno dni 1442.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The vicar&rsquo;s spelling is bad for this time, and his
account is curiously inaccurate.&nbsp; Bishop Scroope&rsquo;s
Christian name was Thomas, not Richard, and he died in 1491, not
1364.&nbsp; The Jettors were an old Lowestoft family, and we have
seen their names in the Subsidy Rolls for 1524, in which John
Jettor, senr., of that date, appears as possessed of &pound;10
worth of &ldquo;movabyll goods.&rdquo;&nbsp; The existence of
brasses in the Parish Church commemorating 12 generations of this
family before 1644 was very improbable.&nbsp; No such name as
John Goodknapp appears in the list of vicars in the Diocesan
Register.</p>
<p>It appears that the &ldquo;litle bell,&rdquo; which was cast
from the brasses taken from the church, was in use as the chapel
bell in Gillingwater&rsquo;s time at the end of the last
century.&nbsp; It was re-cast when the chapel was converted into
the Town Hall; in the tower of which it still hangs, and sounds
the hours for the Town Clock.</p>
<p><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>Although both Yarmouth and Lowestoft must have suffered
with the rest of the country from the restrictions on social and
commercial intercourse during these sad times, the fishing
business seems to have improved rather than otherwise, owing to a
diminution in the number of foreign competitors, and an increase
in the exportation of fish.</p>
<p>There appears to have been a considerable increase in the
number of ships sent from both towns to the cod fishery off
Iceland, and to the herring fishery in the North Sea.&nbsp;
During the years 1641 and 1649, the Yarmouth cod fishing reached
its greatest height.&nbsp; The ships destroyed by the
&ldquo;pirates&rdquo; in 1644 were soon replaced, and the
accounts shew that no less than 33 barks were sent to the Iceland
fishery in 1648, besides 182 boats employed in the herring
fishery.&nbsp; According to Gillingwater, as many as 30 ships
were employed by Lowestoft in the same fisheries at this
one.&nbsp; If this was the case, the Lowestoft fishermen must
have made a great advance since the days of Elizabeth, when we
were told by Mr. Mighells that their ships going to Iceland had
been reduced to one.</p>
<p>Gillingwater gives a full account of the cod fishery, as
carried on by the Lowestoft fishermen, and tells us that in his
time&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There was a trench still visible upon the
Denes, a little to the north of Lowestoft, in which stood the
blubber coppers where they used to boil the livers of the fish
when they returned home from the voyage.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Great Fire of</span> 1644.</h4>
<p>It was in 1644, the year after Cromwell&rsquo;s visit, that
Lowestoft suffered the greatest calamity with which the town was
ever afflicted, before or since.&nbsp; On the 10th March in that
year, we are told, by Mr. Rous,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There happened in this towne a most violent
and dreadful fire which consumed and burnt down soe many houses
above and beneath the cliffe, as could not be rebuilt according
to the judgement of knowing artificers who viewed it for above
ten thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>It
appears from the account of a survey of the losses incurred by
the different owners, that the totals comprised &pound;4,145 10.
on dwelling houses, on fish-houses &pound;3,085 0. 0. and on
goods &pound;3,066 12. 4. <a name="citation90a"></a><a
href="#footnote90a" class="citation">[90a]</a></p>
<p>The number of houses burnt was stated afterwards to have been
140. <a name="citation90b"></a><a href="#footnote90b"
class="citation">[90b]</a>&nbsp; According to a survey made in
1642 the yearly value of the houses and tenements in the Parish
was put at &pound;412 6. 8., and the value of land at &pound;447
11. 8., making a total of &pound;859 18. 4.&nbsp; As the
valuation of the houses and fish-houses burnt was &pound;7,000, a
sum which at as low a rate as 5 per cent would represent an
annual value of &pound;350, the property burnt would appear to
have been much the larger part in value of all the houses and
tenements in the town.</p>
<p>Considering how simple the construction of even the better
class of houses was at this time, the value put upon the dwelling
houses burnt, would seem to imply that they included many of the
best houses on the cliff, where the owners of the fish-houses at
the bottom resided: though the fire does not seem to have reached
the house, which still exists at the top of Wilde&rsquo;s
Score.</p>
<p>The losses of the owners on fish-houses ranged from &pound;25
to &pound;450.&nbsp; Mr. Josiah Wilde&rsquo;s loss was &pound;400
on fish-houses.&nbsp; Doubtless this included the large
fish-house at the bottom of Wilde&rsquo;s Score.&nbsp; Many of
these fish-houses had probably been built in the early times of
the Edwards and the Henrys.&nbsp; In a statement made some 20
years afterwards these fish-houses, then restored, are referred
to as &ldquo;monuments&rdquo; proving the antiquity of the trades
of the town.</p>
<p>In 1649 another valuation was made, in pursuance of an order
of the Parliament.&nbsp; According to this valuation the value of
property in the parish had been much reduced since 1641.&nbsp;
The yearly value of all the lands and tenements in <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>the parish
was put then at &pound;655.&nbsp; Doubtless this reduction was
mainly due to the loss of property caused by the fire.&nbsp; But
assuming that the value of the house property at this period was
very small; and the annual value of land still less, it is
impossible to reconcile these statements of the yearly value of
the whole parish, with the valuation of the property destroyed by
the fire.&nbsp; The explanation of the discrepancy would seem to
be that the valuation of their property by our old townspeople to
furnish a basis for taxation, was on a very different principle
to that on which it was valued for the purpose of supporting a
claim for exemption.&nbsp; Probably houses had no marketable or
ascertainable value either for sale or letting at this time, and
the estimate of either their capital or annual value would be of
a very speculative character.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Value of Moveable Goods</span>.</h4>
<p>The value of the &ldquo;goods&rdquo; lost by the fire is put
at &pound;3,066.&nbsp; This amount of property was owned by some
60 out of the three or four hundred householders which the town
contained.&nbsp; The loss of Mr. Josiah Wilde was put at
&pound;280; the loss of Mr. Robert Bits at &pound;370.&nbsp; As
the small sum of &pound;2 is given as the value of the goods lost
by some of the smaller sufferers, we must regard the valuation of
goods destroyed as sufficiently trustworthy to give an idea of
the value of the stock in trade and furniture possessed by the
merchants and tradesmen of the town at this period.&nbsp; A
comparison of this valuation with the &pound;790 returned as the
value of the &ldquo;movabyll goods&rdquo; possessed by our
townspeople in 1524, shews how largely the wealth of our
merchants had increased since that time, notwithstanding the
decay of their fisheries, and the other adverse circumstances
against which they had been struggling, and how great had been
the increase in the furniture and other commodities of life,
which was noticed by Holinshed as commencing in Elizabeth&rsquo;s
time.</p>
<p>But even so the inhabitants generally must have been very poor
and badly housed compared with the present day.</p>
<p><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>Putting
1,500 acres (nearly the whole acreage of the Parish) as the
quantity of land valued in 1642 at &pound;447. 11. 8. we have an
annual value at that time of about 6 shillings an acre.&nbsp; The
quantity of land in the Parish now rated as agricultural land is
about 760 acres, and the rateable value &pound;994 or about 28
shillings per acre; not 5 times its value in 1642.</p>
<p>Putting 400 as the number of houses having an aggregate value
in 1642 of &pound;412 we should have an average annual value of
about &pound;1 per house.&nbsp; The number of houses now in the
parish (of course apart from Kirkley), is 4,867 and the rateable
value &pound;77,680, giving an average value of about &pound;16
per house, or 16 times that of 1642.&nbsp; This very great
increase of value represents in the main the difference in the
character of the dwellings in which our ancestors lived, and of
those required by an advanced civilization.&nbsp; Writing in 1790
Gillingwater gives the following description of the town at that
time:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lowestoft is about a mile in length, and
consists chiefly of one principal street, running in a gradual
descent from north to south, which is intersected by several
smaller streets or lanes from the west.&nbsp; It is well paved,
particularly High street, and consists of about 445 houses,
exclusive of fish-houses, which are chiefly built of brick.&nbsp;
Several of the houses have been lately rebuilt in the modern
style, and make a handsome appearance.&nbsp; <i>It is probable
that the town consists of much the same number of houses now as
it had many years ago</i>; <i>there being very few houses erected
upon new foundations</i>, <i>but only rebuilt upon the old
ones</i>.&nbsp; <i>Lowestoft contains about 2,231
inhabitants</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation92"></a><a
href="#footnote92" class="citation">[92]</a></p>

Time of Charles</span> II.</h3>
<h4><span class="smcap">Third and Last Contest with Yarmouth
about their Charter</span>.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Conclusion</span>.</h4>
<p>It was while our merchants were suffering from their losses
caused by the great fire, that the Yarmouth people made a third
effort to enforce the privileges of their ancient charters now
confirmed and strengthened by the charter of James I.&nbsp; It
appears that for some years before 1659, they had sent boats into
the roads off Lowestoft to exact harbour dues from fishing boats,
but in this year they took a much stronger measure.&nbsp; They
had in their harbour a large ship, probably the Queen&rsquo;s
ship which we have before heard of as used for war-like
purposes.&nbsp; They fitted out this ship as a &ldquo;man of
war&rdquo; and sent her to ride in the roads off Lowestoft.&nbsp;
The ship was formally &ldquo;commissioned&rdquo; by the Yarmouth
bailiffs under the command of Thomas Allen, a namesake of the
Lowestoft champion, to prevent the Western fishermen and other
strangers selling their fish to the Lowestoft merchants in the
roads; with power to seize their ships, etc.&nbsp; The &ldquo;man
of war&rdquo; was sufficiently formidable to terrorise the
strangers, but not the Lowestoft men, who having well armed
themselves for the encounter, went out in their boats to attack
it.&nbsp; According to the statement of the Yarmouth
bailiffs&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The chief men of the said town came upon
the said Thomas Allen and his company in the road of the said
town, violently and riotously in boats, and with force of arms,
etc., drave him and them out of the road, threatening them
otherwise to fire their vessel.&nbsp; Whereby the said Thomas
Allen with his vessel and company was forced to come away without
doing anything.&rdquo; <a name="citation93"></a><a
href="#footnote93" class="citation">[93]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>In
consequence of this vigorous action on the part of the Lowestoft
men the ship was sent again sufficiently armed to resist any
second attack, and</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With a flag on the maintop-roast head,
having 25 men on board, armed with swords, half-pikes, muskets,
and a great store of stones, the ship sails into the roads of
Corton, Lowestoft and Kirkley, during the chiefest part of the
season, daily chasing the fishermen so that none durst deliver
any herrings.&rdquo; <a name="citation94a"></a><a
href="#footnote94a" class="citation">[94a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to a statement in a petition of the inhabitants of
Lowestoft to the House of Lords, <a name="citation94b"></a><a
href="#footnote94b" class="citation">[94b]</a> the effect of
these very high-handed proceedings on the part of the Yarmouth
bailiffs was that the Lowestoft merchants were deprived of
&ldquo;at least a thousand lasts of herrings,&rdquo; which they
would otherwise have purchased from their visitors during the
season.&nbsp; This was probably an exaggeration, but it was
evident that unless this assertion of their privileges by the
Yarmouth bailiffs was at once resisted, the herring-trade of
Lowestoft would be annihilated at a time when its merchants had
been rebuilding and enlarging their fish-houses with a view to an
increase of their fish-curing trade.&nbsp; It was stated that at
this time they had capacity in their fish-houses for
&ldquo;hanging&rdquo; 700 lasts of herrings.&nbsp; This number of
lasts were &ldquo;hung&rdquo; in the Lowestoft curing houses in
1674, <a name="citation94c"></a><a href="#footnote94c"
class="citation">[94c]</a> a larger number than could be hung at
one time in our present curing houses.&nbsp; But the number of
herrings cured in the town would only be part of the quantity
passing through the merchant&rsquo;s hands&mdash;then and
now.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Lowestoft Appeals to the King against
Yarmouth</span>.</h4>
<p>Impoverished as the merchants were by their losses from the
fire, and the expense of rebuilding their houses and fish-houses,
they bravely determined to resist the pretensions of Yarmouth by
another appeal to the governing powers of the country, and at
once took steps to gain the support and co-operation of other
towns interested in the herring trade.</p>
<p><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>Meanwhile events had been taking place of much more
importance to the country than the quarrel between Lowestoft and
Yarmouth.&nbsp; The Cromwellian rule had come to an end, and a
King again sat on the throne of England.&nbsp; Yarmouth had lost
the claim to the favour of the crown which her ancestors had
enjoyed in the days of the Edwards.&nbsp; She must secure the
favour of the new King by other means.&nbsp; Before his landing,
the Burgesses had met and determined that it was &ldquo;a
convenient season&rdquo; to send an address to their King with
the offer of a little pecuniary assistance.&nbsp; In August,
1660, they submitted a most loyal address to their &ldquo;dread
sovereign&rdquo; congratulating him upon his being restored to
his rights and possessions, etc., and acknowledging in all
humility their obligation to pay the old fee-farm rent (which
they had already paid to Cromwell by composition), and tendering
him &pound;266 13. 4. in cash for arrears.&nbsp; In the following
December they sent him a further present of &pound;500. <a
name="citation95"></a><a href="#footnote95"
class="citation">[95]</a></p>
<p>The Lowestoft people had no reason to doubt the good will of
Charles, and they commenced their suit by a petition to the King
himself complaining of the conduct of the Yarmouth bailiffs, and
supporting it by numerous petitions to the House of Lords, the
Judges, the Fishmonger&rsquo;s Company, and many great men of the
day.&nbsp; This Petition to the King was very favourably
received, as appears from the following reply from His Majesty,
dated 17th October, 1660, at the court of Whitehall,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The situation of the town of Lowestoft
being very well known unto His Majesty, who is much dissatisfied
with the proceedings of the town of Yarmouth, mentioned in the
petition of the said town of Lowestoft, he is graciously pleased
to refer the consideration of the said petition to the Right
Honourable the Lords of His Majesty&rsquo;s most Honourable the
Privy Council, to give such orders for the relief and
satisfaction of the said petitioners as they in their great
wisdom shall think meet.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Signed</i> <span
class="smcap">Robert Mason</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lowestoft people were so pleased with the King&rsquo;s <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>expression of
sympathy with their cause, that they submitted a second petition
to him asking him to preside in person at the hearing of the
case, and &ldquo;to put an end to all differences according to
the rights and justice of their cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King did attend the hearing of the case, but he did not
gratify the expectations of our old townspeople by deciding it in
their favour at once.</p>
<p>The case was heard by the Privy Council on several days before
the King, the Duke of York, and many great officers of state and
noblemen.&nbsp; As when the case was brought before the Star
Chamber in Elizabeth&rsquo;s time, the Privy Council attempted to
get the matter settled by referring it to the law
authorities.&nbsp; But these learned persons found themselves
equally unable to settle the dispute on legal grounds, and it was
accordingly referred to the House of Lords.&nbsp; After the suit
had been for upwards of two years under discussion by these
various authorities, the House of Lords gave their decision,
which was simply a repetition of the decision of the judges in
Elizabeth&rsquo;s time, but it was supplemented by an order to
the Sheriffs of Norfolk and Suffolk, to measure the distance of
seven miles from the &ldquo;Crane Key&rdquo; at Yarmouth, along
the shore towards Lowestoft, and to place there a new post to
mark the limits, &ldquo;within which the Bailiffs and Corporation
of Yarmouth are to enjoy their full privileges and immunities, as
the said statute of the 31st, Edward III., and their charter do
afford them, and no further.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Proceedings at Yarmouth about the
Measurement of the Seven Miles</span>.</h4>
<p>The 27th of May 1662, was agreed upon by the Sheriffs for
making the measurement in pursuance of the order of the House of
Lords, and at 9 o&rsquo;clock in the morning of the appointed
day, a number of Suffolk gentlemen, including seven Justices of
the Peace, living near Lowestoft, and <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>accompanied by the Under Sheriff of
Suffolk, appeared at Yarmouth.&nbsp; Neither the Sheriff of
Norfolk, Sir Richard Bacon, nor the Under Sheriff, Mr. Roger
Smith, of Norwich, had arrived; but at 11 o&rsquo;clock Mr. Roger
Smith put in an appearance, and excused the absence of the High
Sheriff on the ground that he was at his house about 30 miles
away, and not in health.</p>
<p>A long altercation then took place between the Suffolk
gentlemen and the Under Sheriff of Norfolk.&nbsp; Mr. Roger Smith
took the bold course of denying that the House of Lords had
&ldquo;the power to take away another man&rsquo;s rights,&rdquo;
and professed to be quite unable to satisfy himself at what point
the measurement should commence, etc.&nbsp; At length having
firmly maintained his position till dinner, he left the Suffolk
gentlemen and dined with the Bailiffs.</p>
<p>Having waited till Mr. Smith had finished his dinner, the
Suffolk gentlemen again requested him to join in the measurement,
but now he was not only obdurate but returned &ldquo;unhandsome
answers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Accordingly at the request of the Lowestoft
men, the Suffolk Justices and the Under Sheriff engaged two
surveyors and undertook to make the measurement without
him.&nbsp; They commenced at the &ldquo;Crane Key&rdquo; about 4
o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon &ldquo;pursued by multitudes with
much insolence and disturbance.&rdquo;&nbsp; They rode along the
shore under the cliff watching the surveyors laying their chain
and completed their task about half an hour before sunset.&nbsp;
Having marked the place for the new post, a few yards nearer
Yarmouth than that of the &ldquo;ancient&rdquo; post, (that put
up in Elizabeth&rsquo;s time) they went on to Lowestoft and
stayed there for the night.</p>
<p>The following day was spent in great rejoicing at
Lowestoft.&nbsp; The High Sheriff of Suffolk had now joined the
party, and they were entertained by the town at the Swan
Hotel.</p>
<p><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>A post
was soon afterwards set up at the spot fixed upon, but the
Yarmouth men acting on the advice of Mr. Roger Smith, refused to
recognise it, and the Lowestoft men had again to appeal to the
Lords to enforce their order.&nbsp; In the following April the
House of Lords issued their warrant to their Sergeant-at-Arms to
take into custody Roger Smith, the Under Sheriff of Norfolk and
ordered that the measurement should be executed again by the two
sheriffs.&nbsp; This was done, without further interruption, on
the 10th June following, and another post fixed.</p>
<p>Mr. Roger Smith having been detained in custody for about a
fortnight petitioned to be released on the ground that as long as
he was in prison the King&rsquo;s taxes could not be
collected.&nbsp; He was brought to the Bar of the House of Lords
and ordered to make instant submission upon his knees at the bar
of that house, before their lordships, in the words
following.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I do humbly beg your Lordships&rsquo;
pardon, and express very hearty sorrow for not executing your
Lordships&rsquo; order, and for any unadvised words uttered by
me, which might have any reflection on your Lordships&rsquo;
judgement and order concerning the matter in difference between
the towns of Lowestoft and Yarmouth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was further ordered that he should make the same humble
submission before the people on the &ldquo;Crane Key&rdquo; at
Yarmouth.&nbsp; On these conditions he was released.&nbsp;
Doubtless both acts of penance were duly performed.</p>
<p>Although the ghost of the old charter was not finally laid by
the result of the contest, it was the last time that the
expensive process of an appeal to the Crown, or to Parliament,
was resorted to for settling the disputes which it gave rise to
between the two towns.&nbsp; The expenses of this protracted
suit, defrayed by Lowestoft, amounted to &pound;600, not a very
large sum compared with modern experiences.</p>
<p>In order to prevent the question being again raised by
Yarmouth as to the distance to which their privileges extended,
<a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>when
Charles II. gave the town a new charter in 1684, a special
proviso was inserted in it&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That the word leuca mentioned in divers
former charters signifies an English mile and no more, as
declared by the House of Lords in the 15th year of our
reign.&rdquo; <a name="citation99"></a><a href="#footnote99"
class="citation">[99]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus the town was compelled to accept a construction of the
provisions of their old charter which excluded Lowestoft from the
area of their application.</p>
<h4>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Corton Pole</span>.&rdquo;</h4>
<p>The spot where the 7 miles, measured from the Crane Quay at
Yarmouth, was found to terminate, was in Gunton Denes about 150
yards this side of the Corton boundary.&nbsp; The post set up in
1663 was washed down a few years afterwards.&nbsp; It had been
placed too near the sea, which at that period was advancing on
the land at this part of the coast; and in 1676 another post was
fixed, a few yards further inland, in the presence of a number of
leading men representing the counties of Norfolk and
Suffolk.&nbsp; This post has been also replaced more than once
since, but it is still represented by the post known as the
&ldquo;Corton Pole.&rdquo;&nbsp; The present post, and one or two
of its predecessors, have been used by the Corton Coast Guard for
practising their life saving apparatus, and its interesting
connection with the history of our old town is not generally
known.&nbsp; Old men however still remember this post being known
as a boundary mark beyond which Lowestoft people might not land
fish.&nbsp; As Gillingwater does not mention any further
replacing of the post before he wrote his history, it may be
inferred that the post set up in 1676 was standing in his
time.&nbsp; From what I have learnt as to the replacing of the
posts in later years by the Coast Guard, it would appear that the
present post is nearly in the same position as the posts of 1676,
and 1596.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Effect of the Successful Termination of
the Suit</span>.</h4>
<p>The success of our old townspeople in their contest with <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>Yarmouth
appears to have had the effect of reviving their energies, and
encouraged them to take active measures for improving their hold
on the herring trade, and increasing the number of ships employed
by themselves in the fishery.</p>
<p>But at this time the trade appears to have been again in a
depressed state owing to the Dutch war.&nbsp; According to a
statement in their petition to Parliament in 1670, one half of
the fishing adventurers of the town had given up the business and
their fishermen were lamentably impoverished.</p>
<p>Our old town was however now in good favour with the
government.&nbsp; Several of its seamen were doing good service
in the Kings&rsquo; navy against the Dutch, and they had a good
friend in Parliament in the old royalist Sir John Pettus, who had
been one of the &ldquo;strangers&rdquo; captured by Cromwell in
Lowestoft some 30 years before.&nbsp; They employed him to
present petitions to Parliament on behalf of their own and the
fishermen of other Suffolk towns.</p>
<p>One of these proposals was that &ldquo;fishing beer&rdquo;
should be exempted from the excise duty.&nbsp; In connection with
this proposal a return was made of the number of fishing boats
employed by Lowestoft and the neighbouring Suffolk fishing
villages.&nbsp; From this return it appears that at this time
Lowestoft sent out 25 boats, Pakefield and Kirkley 14, Southwold
11, Aldborough 5, Corton 2, and Dunwich 1.</p>
<p>The consumption of beer by the crews of these 58 boats was
estimated at 9 tuns per boat, amounting altogether to 522
tuns.&nbsp; It is probable that in these days a liberal supply of
beer, which was very cheap, compensated for a deficiency in good
food.&nbsp; Since the invention of tea, coffee and cocoa, beer is
happily no longer necessary on board a fishing boat and has long
since ceased to form part of the provisions carried by Lowestoft
boats.</p>
<p>In 1679 we find our old townspeople taking steps for advancing
the general mercantile trade of town, by petitioning the Treasury
to allow their merchants to export <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>corn, and import coal. <a
name="citation101"></a><a href="#footnote101"
class="citation">[101]</a>&nbsp; This was not granted, nor can we
see how, without a harbour, the ambitious project of engaging in
such trades could be entertained.&nbsp; Leave was however given
for the exportation of butter, cheese, and fish and for the
importation of all materials requisite for building and
furnishing ships.</p>
<p>It was stated in this Petition that the town had then
increased its shipping to the number of 60 vessels&mdash;a rapid
advance on the 25 ships possessed 9 years before.&nbsp; As we are
told by Gillingwater that the number of boats employed at
Lowestoft in the herring fishery during the years
1722&ndash;1781, averaged about 33, there could have been no
further advance in the fishing business until quite recent
years.&nbsp; It is evident that our old townspeople had been
bestirring themselves, and were making good use of the
opportunity which the absence of Dutch busses from this side of
the North Sea now offered.</p>
<p>With such evidence of a revival of life and energy in our old
Town, and the promise of further growth and commercial
development in the future, (a promise since so happily realised),
we may close our sketch of Lowestoft in olden times.</p>
<p>It has given us glimpses of our old townspeople during four
centuries of a chequered career during which they established and
maintained their position with very little help from natural
advantages or local circumstances.&nbsp; Without a harbour they
were unable to make any material advance in either wealth or
population.&nbsp; But small as the old town was it was able to
contribute largely to the manning of the fleets which fought for
England against the Dutch and other powers during the latter part
of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th century, and to claim
as her own sons many of the brave seamen who added to the glory
of the national flag during those wars.&nbsp; A short notice of
these Lowestoft heroes will be a fitting conclusion to our
sketch.&nbsp; <a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>A full account of their exploits is to be found in
Gillingwater.</p>
<p>You are already acquainted with Mr. Thomas Allen, one of
Cromwell&rsquo;s prisoners in 1643.&nbsp; He belonged to an old
Lowestoft family.&nbsp; In the navy of Charles II. he held many
high commands, and as an Admiral, took a prominent part in some
of the fierce conflicts of the First Dutch War.&nbsp; In 1669 he
retired from active service and was created a Baronet.&nbsp;
Having acquired a handsome fortune, by opportunities not given to
our sea warriors of the present day, he bought the Somerleyton
Estate and resided in the old Hall for several years.</p>
<p>Admiral Utber and his son, Captain Utber, were also Lowestoft
men who served with Admiral Allen in the Dutch Wars, and
performed many distinguished services.</p>
<p>Sir John Ashby was another gallant seaman belonging to an old
Lowestoft family.&nbsp; He was much distinguished for his
services both as Captain and Admiral in the wars against France,
in the time of William III.&nbsp; He was in command as Admiral of
the Blue at the celebrated battle of La Hogue.</p>
<p>Another Lowestoft man, Sir Andrew Leake, was distinguished for
his services in the war against France and Spain, in the early
part of the reign of Queen Ann.&nbsp; He took part in the Capture
of Gibraltar in 1704, and afterwards in the great battle off
Malaga in the same year, in which he lost his life.&nbsp; (He
must not be confused with his namesake, Sir John Leake, the hero
of the siege.)</p>
<p>Another distinguished seaman was Admiral Mighells.&nbsp; He
belonged to a well-known Lowestoft family, which had held a
leading position in the town for more than a hundred years.&nbsp;
The name has been mentioned more than once in these
lectures.&nbsp; He was distinguished for his services in the war
against Spain in 1719.</p>
<p><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>The
last of our naval heroes, whose early career associated him with
those already mentioned, was Captain Thomas Arnold.&nbsp; He
earned great distinction in an action against the Spanish Fleet
when serving under Admiral George Byng in 1718.&nbsp; He belonged
to a family which had held a high position in the town for more
than century, and which still holds the same position amongst
us.&nbsp; The prestige of this family has been since enhanced by
the celebrity of others of its members&mdash;the great
educational Reformer, Dr. Arnold, Head Master of Rugby School,
and his son, Matthew Arnold, one of the most distinguished of the
poets and essayists of the Victorian Era.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
